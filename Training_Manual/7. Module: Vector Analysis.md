# 7. Module: Vector Analysis

[Exercise data and Additional eductional material](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/12PU6W50dCzEau_1PNXaGbd8vZNCVWPNz?ths=true)

Now that you have edited a few features, you must want to know what else one can do with them. Having features with attributes is nice, but when all is said and done, this doesn’t really tell you anything that a normal, non-GIS map can’t.

The key advantage of a GIS is this: _a GIS can answer questions_.

For the next three modules, we’ll endeavor to answer a _research question_ using GIS functions. For example, you are interested in the possible locations for villae with the following criteria (note these are not based on historical requirements!):

1. They are within roughly 1h walking (5000m) from Tagili.
2. They must be on cultivated land.
3. Closer than 1500m to the main road.
4. Closer than 500m to a river.

Within the next few modules, we’ll harness the power of GIS analysis tools to locate suitable properties for this new residential development.

## 7.1. Lesson: Reprojecting and Transforming Data
Let us talk about Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) again. We have touched on this briefly before, but haven’t discussed what it means practically.

**The goal for this lesson:** To reproject and transform vector datasets.

### 7.1.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Projections
The CRS that all the data, as well as the map itself are in right now is called ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N. This is not a very common Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) for representing data. It is ideal for the Iberian Peninsula, but problematic for other regions.
However, all projections have their issues. We will open a new project with a standard CRS: WGS84. This is a very common Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) for representing data. It is used in the Global Position System. But there’s a problem, as we will see.

1. Open a new project
2. Then type _`world`_ in the **``Coordinate``** field, which is in the **Statusbar** along the bottom of the screen. A **_World Map_** Layer will be added to the empty project.

![7.1.1 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.1.1%20A.png)

4. Zoom in to Spain by using the **`Zoom In`** tool
5. Try setting a scale in the **``Scale``** field, which is in the **Statusbar** next to the **``Coordinate``** field the bottom of the screen. While over Spain, set this value to _`1:5 000 000`_ (one to five million).
6. Pan around the map while keeping an eye on the Scale field

Notice the scale changing? That’s because you are moving away from the one point that you zoomed into at _`1:6 000 000`_, which was at the center of your screen. All around that point, the scale is different.

To understand why, think about a globe of the Earth. It has lines running along it from North to South. These longitude lines are far apart at the equator, but they meet at the poles.

In a GCS, you are working on this sphere, but your screen is flat. When you try to represent the sphere on a flat surface, distortion occurs, similar to what would happen if you cut open a tennis ball and tried to flatten it out. What this means on a map is that the longitude lines stay equally far apart from each other, even at the poles (where they are supposed to meet). This means that, as you travel away from the equator on your map, the scale of the objects that you see gets larger and larger. What this means for us, practically, is that there is no constant scale on our map!

Hannah Fry made a good video for Numberphile explaining the issues and challenges of different projections: [A Strange Map Projection (Euler Spiral)](https://youtu.be/D3tdW9l1690)

To solve this, let’s use a Projected Coordinate System (PCS) instead. A PCS “projects” or converts the data in a way that makes allowance for the scale change and corrects it. Therefore, to keep the scale constant, we should reproject our data to use a PCS.

### 7.1.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: “On the Fly” Reprojection
By default, QGIS reprojects data “on the fly”. What this means is that even if the data itself is in another CRS, QGIS can project it as if it were in a CRS of your choice.

You can change the CRS of the project by clicking on the ![projectionEnabled](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mIconProjectionEnabled.png)**`Current projection`** button in the bottom right corner of QGIS.

1. In the dialog that appears, type _`30N`_ into the **``Filter``** field. A few CRSs should appear in the **``Predefined Reference Systems``** field below.
2. Select **`EPSG:25830 ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N`** entry by clicking on it, and then click **``OK``**.
   Notice how the shape of Spain (and the whole world) changes. All projections work by changing the apparent shapes of objects on Earth.
3. Zoom to a scale of _`1:6 000 000`_ again, as before.
4. Pan around the map.

Notice how the scale stays the same!

“On the fly” reprojection is also used for combining datasets that are in different CRSs.

1. Add another vector layer to your map which has the data for Spain only. You will find it in the Module 7 _**exercise_data**_ as _**L07_Pleiades_IP_Places (WGS84)**_.
2. Load it. A quick way to see its CRS is by hovering the mouse over the layer in the legend. It is **`EPSG:4326`**.
   What do you notice?

The layer is visible even if it has a different CRS from the **``World Map``** one.

### 7.1.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Saving a Dataset to Another CRS
Sometimes you need to export an existing dataset with another CRS. As we will see in the next lesson, if you need to make distance calculations on layer, it is always better to have the layer in a projected coordinate system.

Be aware that the ‘on the fly’ reprojection is related to the **project** and not to single layers. This means that a layer can have a different CRS from the project even if you see it in the correct position.

You can easily export the layer with another CRS.

1. Right-click on the _**L07_Pleiades_IP_Places (WGS84)**_ layer in the **``Layers``** panel
2. Select **``Export ‣ Save Features As…``** in the menu that appears. You will be shown the **``Save Vector Layer as…``** dialog.
3. Click on the **``Browse``** button next to the **``File name``** field
4. Navigate to _**exercise_data/**_ and specify the name of the new layer as _**L07_Pleiades_IP_Places (UTM 30N)**_.
5. Change the value of the **``CRS``**. Only the recent CRSs used will be shown in the drop-down menu. Click on the ![setProjection](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionSetProjection.png) **`Select projection`** button next to the drop-down menu.
6. The **``Coordinate Reference System Selector``** dialog will appear. In its **``Filter``** field, search for _`30N`_.
7. Select **``EPSG:25830 ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N``** from the list

![7.1.3 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.1.3%20A.png)

8. Leave the other options unchanged. The **``Save Vector Layer as…``** dialog now looks like this:

![7.1.3 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.1.3%20B.png)

9. Click **``OK``**

You can now compare the old and new projections of the layer and see that they are in two different CRS but they are still overlapping.

### 7.1.4. In Conclusion
Different projections are useful for different purposes. By choosing the correct projection, you can ensure that the features on your map are being represented accurately.

### 7.1.5. What’s Next?
In the next lesson you will learn how to analyze vector data using QGIS’ various vector analysis tools.

## 7.2. Lesson: Vector Analysis
Vector data can also be analyzed to reveal how different features interact with each other in space. There are many different analysis-related functions, so we won’t go through them all. Rather, we will pose a question and try to solve it using the tools that QGIS provides.

**The goal for this lesson:** To ask a question and solve it using analysis tools.

### 7.2.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) The GIS Process
Before we start, it would be useful to give a brief overview of a process that can be used to solve a problem. The way to go about it is:

1. State the Problem
2. Get the Data
3. Analyze the Problem
4. Present the Results

### 7.2.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) The Problem
Let’s start off the process by deciding on a problem to solve. For example, you are looking for possible locations of villae sites near Tagili (remember, these are not based on historical requirements!):

1. They are within roughly 1h walking (5000m) from Tagili.
2. They must be on cultivated land.
3. Closer than 1500m to the main road.
4. Closer than 500m to a river.

### 7.2.3. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) The Data
To answer these questions, we are going to need the following data:

1. The location of Tagili
2. The landuse of the Almanzora basin
3. The main road
4. The rivers of the Almanzora basin

The first three sets of data are available in the dataset you have been using throughout this manual and can be found in the Module 7 exercise data folder. Only the layer for the rivers of the Almanzora basin (_**L07_BTN100_rivers**_) is new and can also be found in the Module 7 exercise data folder.

### 7.2.4. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Start a Project and get the Data
We first need to load the data to work with.

1. Start a new QGIS project
2. In the Module 7 exercise data, you will find the datasets we will use in this chapter. You can also use the data you have been using throughout the course:

   1. _**E2KC_cities**_ for the location of Tagili
   2. _**CLC_LanduseAlmanzora**_ for the landuse
   3. _**routes**_ for the main road through the basin
   4. _**L07_BTN100_rivers**_ for the rivers (this one needs to be added from the exercise data of Module 7)

Make sure you have these layers in your project and that they are in the correct CRS: **``EPSG:25830 ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N``**.

4. Zoom to the layer extent of _**CLC_LanduseAlmanzora**_ to see our area.

Before proceeding we will filter the _**CLC_LanduseAlmanzora**_, in order to have only the cultivated landuse types to work with. These are:

  + 211   Non-irrigated arable land
  + 212   Permanently irrigated land
  + 222   Fruit tree and berry plantations
  + 242   Complex cultivation patterns 
  + 243   Agriculture, with significant areas of natural vegetation

5. Right click on the _**CLC_LanduseAlmanzora**_ layer and choose **``Filter…``**.

6. In the dialog that pops up we filter these features with the following expression:

   _`` "Code"  Between 200 AND   300 ``_ 

The **`Code`** field holds the numerical values related to the landuse.

**``! Note``** When trying to use the expression above with the **`CODE_90`** field it does not work. Eventhough both field seem to hold the same numerical values in the attribute table, the outcome is different. Check the **``Layer Properties ‣ Manage Fields``**  to see the difference between the Field type of the fields **`Code`** and **` CODE_90`**. As the **`CODE_90`** field type is **`String`** the values in the field are treated as text rather than numbers. Therefore the expression based on numerical values does not work for **`CODE_90`**. 

![7.2.4 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.4%20A.png)

Note the ![indicatorFilter](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mIndicatorFilter.png) icon next to the Landuse layer. It helps you remember that this layer has a filter activated, so some features may not be available in the project.

The map with all the data should look like the following one:

![7.2.4 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.4%20B.png)

### 7.2.5. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Analyzing the Problem: Distances From Rivers and Road
QGIS allows you to calculate distances between any vector object.

1. Make sure that only the _**routes**_ and _**BTN100_rivers**_ layers are visible (to simplify the map while you’re working)
2. Click on the **``Processing ‣ Toolbox``** to open the analytical core of QGIS. Basically, all algorithms (for vector and raster analysis) are available in this toolbox.
3. We start by calculating the area around the _**routes**_ by using the **``Buffer``** algorithm. You can find it in the **``Vector Geometry``** group.

![7.2.5 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.5%20A.png)

Or you can type _`buffer`_ in the search menu in the upper part of the toolbox:

![7.2.5 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.5%20B.png)

4. Double click on it to open the algorithm dialog
5. Select _**routes**_ as **``Input layer``**, set **``Distance``** to 1500m and use the default values for the rest of the parameters.

The default Distance is in meters because our input dataset is in a Projected Coordinate System that uses meter as its basic measurement unit. You can use the combo box to choose other projected units like kilometers, yards, etc.

**``! Note``** 
If you are trying to make a buffer on a layer with a Geographical Coordinate System, Processing will warn you and suggest to reproject the layer to a metric Coordinate System.

7. By default, **`Processing`** creates temporary layers and adds them to the **``Layers``** panel. You can also save the result to your Module 7 exercise folder:

1. Clicking on the **``…``** button besides `[Create temporary layer]` and choose **``Save to File…``**
2. Naming the new layer _**routes_buffer_1500m**_
3. Saving it in the Module 7 exercise data

![7.2.5 C](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.5%20C.png)

Click on **``Run``**, and then close the **``Buffer``** dialog

Now your map will look something like this:

![7.2.5 D](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.5%20D.png)

If your new layer is at the top of the **``Layers``** list, it will probably obscure much of your map, but this gives you all the areas in your region which are within 1500m of a road.

Use the same approach as above and create a 500 meter buffer for the rivers.
Now your map will look something like this:

![7.2.5 E](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.5%20E.png)

Notice that there are distinct areas within your buffer, which correspond to each individual river (outside the Almanzora basin the same goes for the two raods). To get rid of this problem:

1. Uncheck the **_rivers_buffer_500m_** layer and re-create the buffer with **``Dissolve results``** enabled.

![7.2.5 F](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.5%20F.png)

2. Save the output as **_roads_buffer_50m_dissolved_**
3. Click **``Run``** and close the **``Buffer``** dialog

Once you have added the layer to the **``Layers``** panel, it will look like this:

![7.2.5 G](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.5%20G.png)

Now there are no unnecessary subdivisions.

**``! Note``**
The **Short Help** on the right side of the dialog explains how the algorithm works. If you need more information, just click on the **``Help``** button in the bottom part to open a more detailed guide of the algorithm.

### 7.2.6. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself Distance from Tagili
Use the same approach as above and create a 5000m buffer for Tagili.

Select the city of Tagili from the _**E2KC_Cities**_ layer. Selecting a specific feature can be done in several ways. See the QGIS User Manual to find out how [selecting features](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/general_tools.html?highlight=select%20feature#interacting-with-features) works.

Create the buffer for only the city of Tagili by checking the **`Selected features only`** box.

![7.2.6 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.6%20A.png)

[Check your results](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/Answer_Sheet/Answer_sheet.md#726--try-yourself-distance-from-tagili)

### 7.2.7. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Overlapping Areas
Now we have identified areas within 5 kilometers from Tagili where the road is less than 1500 meters away and are only 500 meters from the nearest rivers. But obviously, we only want the areas where all  these criteria are satisfied. To do that, we will need to use the **``Intersect tool``**. You can find it in **``Vector Overlay``** group in the **``Processing Toolbox``**.

1. Use the _**routes**_ and _**rivers**_ buffer layers as **``Input layer``** and **``Overlay layer``**, save the file  in **``Intersection``** with **``Label name``** _**routes_rivers_intersect**_. Leave the rest as suggested (default).

![7.2.7 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.7%20A.png)

2. Click **``Run``**.

In the image below, the maroon areas are where both of the distance criteria are satisfied.

![7.2.7 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.7%20B.png)

3. You may remove the two buffer layers and only keep the one that shows where they overlap, since that’s what we really wanted to know in the first place.

### 7.2.8. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: One hour from Tagili

We now have a layer which shows us the areas at 500m from the rivers and 1500m from the road through the basin. We now need to reduce that selection to only show the area within 5000m of Tagili.

Using the processes described above, create a new layer called _**routes_rivers_Tagili_intersect**_ which further filters your area to show only those following the distance requirements. 

[Check your results](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/Answer_Sheet/Answer_sheet.md#728--follow-along-one-hour-from-tagili)

### 7.2.9. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Extract the non-cultivated areas
Now you’ve got the area that follows the distance requirements. Next, you want to extract the cultivated land in that area from the Landuse layer.

1. Look for the menu entry **``Vector Selection ‣ Extract by location``** within the _Processing Toolbox_
2. Select _**CLC_LanduseAlmanzora**_ in **``Extract features from``**. Check **``intersect``** in **``Where the features (geometric predicate)``**, select the buffer intersection layer in **``By comparing to the features from``**. Save and name the layer _**LanduseAlmanzora_extracted**_.

![7.2.9 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.9%20A.png)

3. Click **``Run``** and close the dialog
4. You will probably find that not much seems to have changed. If so, move the **``LanduseAlmanzora_extracted``** layer to the top of the layers list.

![7.2.9 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.2.9%20B.png)

The red areas are the cultivated areas which are (partially) within our distance requirements.
Now you have two separated layers and can remove _**CLC_LanduseAlmanzora**_ from the layer list.

### 7.2.10. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself Further Filter
We now have a layer which shows us all the cultivated land (partially) within our distance requirements (1 hour from Tagili, 1.5 km from the road and 500m from a river). We now need to reduce that selection to only show the areas within these boundaries.

To do that, we will need to use the **``Clipping tool``**. You can find it in **``Vector Overlay``** group in the **``Processing Toolbox``**. Follow the steps used above for intersection.

[Check your results](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/Answer_Sheet/Answer_sheet.md#7210--try-yourself-further-filter)

### 7.2.11. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself
Save your solution as a new layer with the layer symbology as you have used before, using the approach you learned above for doing so.

### 7.2.12. In Conclusion
Using the GIS problem solving approach together with QGIS vector analysis tools, you were able to solve a problem with multiple criteria quickly and easily.

### 7.2.14. What’s Next?
In the next lesson, we will look at how to calculate the shortest distance along roads from one point to another.

## 7.3. Lesson: Network Analysis
Calculating the shortest distance between two points is a common GIS task. Tools for this can be found in the **``Processing Toolbox``** via **``Processing ‣ Toolbox``**.

**The goal for this lesson**: learn to use **``Network analysis``** algorithms.

### 7.3.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: The Tools and the Data
You can find all the network analysis algorithms in the **``Processing Toolbox ‣ Network Analysis``** menu. You can see that there are many tools available:

![7.3.1 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.3.1%20A%20select_network_algorithms.png)

Open the project  _**exercise_data/network_analysis/network.qgz.**_ It contains two layers:

* _**network_points**_
* _**network_lines**_

The **_network_lines_** layer has already a style that helps to understand the road network.

![7.3.1 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.3.1%20B%20network_map.png)

The shortest path tools provide ways to calculate either the shortest or the fastest path between two points of a network, given:

* start and end points selected on the map
* start point selected on the map and end points taken from a point layer
* start points taken from a point layer and end point selected on the map

Let’s start.

### 7.3.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Calculate the shortest path (point to point)
The **``Network analysis ‣ Shortest path (point to point)``** allows you to calculate the shortest distance between two manually selected points on the map.

In this example we will calculate the shortest (not fastest) path between two points.

1. Open the **``Shortest path (point to point)``** algorithm
2. Select **``network_lines``** for **``Vector layer representing network``**
3. Use **`Shortest`** for **``Path type to calculate``**

Use these two points as starting and ending points for the analysis:

![7.3.2 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.3.2%20A%20start_end_point.png)

4. Click on the **``…``** button next to **``Start point (x, y)``** and choose the location tagged with _Starting Point_ in the picture. The coordinates of the clicked point are added.
5. Do the same thing, but choosing the location tagged with _Ending point_ for **``End point (x, y)``**
6. Click on the **``Run``** button:

![7.3.2 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.3.2%20B%20shortest_point.png)

7. A new line layer is created representing the shortest path between the chosen points. Uncheck the _**network_lines**_ layer to see the result better:

![7.3.2 C](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.3.2%20B%20shortest_point_result.png)

8. Open the attribute table of the output layer. It contains three fields, representing the coordinates of the start and end points and the **`cost`**.

We chose **`Shortest`** as **``Path type to calculate``**, so the **`cost`** represent the **distance**, in layer units, between the two locations.

In our case, the _shortest_ distance between the chosen points is around _1000_ meters:

![7.3.2 D](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.3.2%20C%20shortest_point_attributes.png)

Now that you know how to use the tool, feel free to test other locations.

### 7.3.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself Fastest path
With the same data of the previous exercise, try to calculate the fastest path between the two points.

How much time do you need to go from the start to the end point?

[Check your results](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/Answer_Sheet/Answer_sheet.md#733--try-yourself-fastest-path)

### 7.3.4. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Advanced options
Let us explore some more options of the Network Analysis tools. In the previous exercise we calculated the **fastest** route between two points. As you can imagine, the time depends on the travel **speed**.

We will use the same layers and starting and ending points of the previous exercises.

1. Open the **``Shortest path (point to point)``** algorithm
2. Fill the **``Input layer``**, **``Start point (x, y)``** and **``End point (x, y)``** as we did before
3. Choose **`Fastest`** as the **``Path type to calculate``**
4. Open the **``Advanced parameter``** menu
5. Change the **``Default speed (km/h)``** from the default _`50`_ value to _`4`_

![7.3.4 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.3.4%20A%20shortest_path_advanced.png)

6. Click on **``Run``**
7. Once the algorithm is finished, close the dialog and open the attribute table of the output layer.

The cost field contains the value according to the speed parameter you have chosen. We can convert the cost field from hours with fractions to the more readable minutes values.

8. Open the field calculator by clicking on the ![calculateField](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionCalculateField.png) icon and add the new field **``minutes``** by multiplying the **``cost``** field by _`60`_:

That’s it! Now you know how many minutes it will take to get from one point to the other one.

### 7.3.5. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Service area (from layer)
The **``Network Analysis ‣ Service area (from layer)``** algorithm can answer the question: given a point layer, what are all the reachable areas given a distance or a time value?

**``! Note``**
The **``Network Analysis ‣ Service area (from point)``** is the same algorithm, but it allows you to manually choose the point on the map.

Given a distance of 250 meters we want to know how far we can go on the network from each point of the **``network_points``** layer.

1. Uncheck all the layers except _**network_points**_
2. Open the **``Network Analysis ‣ Service area (from layer)``** algorithm
3. Choose _**network_lines**_ for **``Vector layer representing network``**
4. Choose _**network_points**_ for **``Vector layer with start points``**
5. Choose **`Shortest`** in **``Path type to calculate``**
6. Enter _`250`_ for the **``Travel cost``** parameter
7. Click on **``Run``** and close the dialog

![7.3.5 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/7.3.5%20A%20service_area.png)

The output layer represents the maximum path you can reach from the point features given a distance of 250 meters:

Cool isn’t it?

### 7.3.6. In Conclusion
Now you know how to use **``Network analysis``** algorithm to solve shortest and fastest path problems.

We are now ready to perform some spatial statistic on vector layer data. Let’s go!

### 7.3.7. What’s Next?
Now that we have covered vector analysis, why not see what can be done with rasters? That is what we will do in the next module!
