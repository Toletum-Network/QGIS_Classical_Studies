# 6. Module: Creating Vector Data

[Additional eductional material](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1RrfCApaXPz24a3TvrDF7dChzbuqNWSBc?ths=true)

Creating maps using existing data is just the beginning. In this module, you’ll learn how to modify existing vector data and create new datasets entirely.

## 6.1. Lesson: Creating a New Vector Dataset
The data that you use has to come from somewhere. For most common applications, the data exists already; but the more particular and specialized the project, the less likely it is that the data will already be available. In such cases, you’ll need to create your own new data.

**The goal for this lesson**: To create a new vector dataset.

### 6.1.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: The Layer Creation Dialog
Before you can add new vector data, you need a vector dataset to add it to. In our case, you’ll begin by creating new data entirely, rather than editing an existing dataset. Therefore, you’ll need to define your own new dataset first.

1. Open QGIS and open the _**GIS Course Module 6**_ project.

   You will notice there is already two layers available in this view (they might not be selected when opened). The two Iberpix layers are Web Map Service (WMS) layers running from the server of the Instituto Geográfica Nacional ([IGN](https://www.ign.es/web/ign/portal)) and used in their online GIS service [Iberpix](https://www.ign.es/iberpix2/visor/). These WMS layers make it possible for us to view the map of Spain without having to save a multitude of large Raster files on our local discs. However, the downside is that it needs an internet connection and takes some time to load the map tiles. We will use this WMS later in this module. So you can switch these off by unchecking them. 
   First we will make an excursion to another site on the Iberian Peninsula: Italica.
   
2. Navigate to and click on the menu entry **``Layer ‣ Create Layer ‣ New Shapefile Layer``**. You’ll be presented with the **``New Shapefile Layer``** dialog, which will allow you to define a new layer.

![6.1.1 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.1%20A.png)

3. Click **``…``** for the **``File name``** field. A save dialog will appear.
4. Navigate to the _exercise_data_ directory.
5. Save your new layer as _Italica.shp_.

   It’s important to decide which kind of dataset you want at this stage. Each different vector layer type is “built differently” in the background, so once you’ve created the layer, you can’t change its type.

   For the next exercise, we’re going to create new features which describe areas. For such features, you’ll need to create a polygon dataset.

6. For **``Geometry Type``**, select **``Polygon``** from the drop down menu:

![6.1.1 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.1%20B.png)

This has no impact on the rest of the dialog, but it will cause the correct type of geometry to be used when the vector dataset is created.

The next field allows you to specify the Coordinate Reference System, or CRS. CRS is a method of associating numerical coordinates with a position on the surface of the Earth. See the User Manual on [Working with Projections](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_projections/working_with_projections.html#label-projections) to learn more.

For this example we will use the default CRS associated with this project, which is EPSG:25830 ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N.

![6.1.1 C](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.1%20C.png)

Next there is a collection of fields grouped under **``New Field``**. By default, a new layer has only one attribute, the _id_ field (which you should see in the **``Fields list``**) below. However, in order for the data you create to be useful, you actually need to say something about the features you’ll be creating in this new layer. For our current purposes, it will be enough to add a field called _Name_ that will hold _Text data_ and will be limited to text length of _80_ characters and a second field called called _Type_ that also holds _Text data_ with a length of _80_ characters.

7. Replicate the setup below, then click the **``Add to Fields List``** button:

![6.1.1 D](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.1%20D.png)

8. Check that your dialog now looks like this:

![6.1.1 E](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.1%20E.png)

9. Click **``OK``**

The new layer should appear in your **``Layers``** panel.

### 6.1.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Data Sources
When you create new data, it obviously has to be about objects that really exist on the ground. Therefore, you’ll need to get your information from somewhere.

There are many different ways to obtain data about objects. For example, you could use a GPS to capture points in the real world, then import the data into QGIS afterwards. Or you could survey points using a theodolite, and enter the coordinates manually to create new features. Or you could use the digitizing process to trace objects from remote sensing data, such as satellite imagery or aerial photography.

For our example, you’ll be using the digitizing approach. A sample raster dataset is provided, so you’ll need to import this as necessary.

1. Click on ![dataSourceManager](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionDataSourceManager.png)_Data Source Manager_ button.
2. Select ![raster](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionAddRasterLayer.png) **``Raster``** on the left side.
3. In the **``Source panel``**, click on the **``…``** button:
4. Navigate to _exercise_data/raster/_.
5. Select the file _L06_PNOA_MA_0984_Italica.tif_.
6. Click **``Open``** to close the dialogue window.

![6.1.2 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20A.png)

7. Click **``Add``** and **``Close``**. An image will load into your map.

![6.1.2 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20B.png)

8. If you don’t see an aerial image appear, select the new layer, right click, and choose **``Zoom to Layer``** in the context menu.

![6.1.2 C](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20C.png)

9. Click on the ![zoomIn](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionZoomIn.png)_Zoom In_ button, and zoom to the area highlighted in blue below:

![6.1.2 D](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20D.png)

Now you are ready to digitize some fields:

![6.1.2 E](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20E.png)

Before starting to digitize, let’s move the _Italica_ layer above the aerial image.

1. Select _Italica_ layer in the **``Layers``** pane and drag it to the top.

![6.1.2 F](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20F.png)

In order to begin digitizing, you’ll need to enter **edit mode**. GIS software commonly requires this to prevent you from accidentally editing or deleting important data. Edit mode is switched on or off individually for each layer.

To enter edit mode for the _Italica_ layer:

1. Click on the _Italica_ layer in the **``Layers``** panel to select it.
2. Click on the ![toggleEditing](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionToggleEditing.png)_Toggle Editing_ button.

If you can’t find this button, check that the **``Digitizing``** toolbar is enabled. There should be a check mark next to the **``View ‣ Toolbars ‣ Digitizing``** menu entry.

As soon as you are in edit mode, you’ll see that some digitizing tools have become active:
   * ![capturePolygon](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionCapturePolygon.png)_Capture Polygon_
   * ![vertexToolActiveLayer](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionVertexToolActiveLayer.png)_Vertex Tool_

Other relevant buttons are still inactive, but will become active when we start interacting with our new data.

Notice that the layer _Italica_ in the Layers panel now has the pencil icon, indicating that it is in edit mode.

3. Click on the ![capturePolygon](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionCapturePolygon.png)_Capture Polygon_ button to begin digitizing the Roman city of Italica.

You’ll notice that your mouse cursor has become a crosshair. This allows you to more accurately place the points you’ll be digitizing. Remember that even when you’re using the digitizing tool, you can zoom in and out on your map by rolling the mouse wheel, and you can pan around by holding down the mouse wheel and dragging around in the map.

The first feature you’ll be digitizing is the Traianeum (the temple to Trajan):

![6.1.2 G](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20G.png)

4. Start digitizing by clicking on a point somewhere along the edge of the field.
5. Place more points by clicking further along the edge, until the shape you’re drawing completely covers the field. Here we already encounter our first challenge: we have to decide which square to digitize. We can opt for the whole area delimited by the roads (ignoring the modern one cutting the Traianeum), or try to follow the outer wall of the temple with all its exedrae. 

![6.1.2 H](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20H.png)

6. After placing your last point, right click to finish drawing the polygon. This will finalize the feature and show you the **``Attributes``** dialog.
7. Fill in the values as below:

![6.1.2 I](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20I.png)

**``! Note``** We have opted to make the attribute _Type_ a numerical attribute. This way difference in writing (capitals, typos etc.) is avoided for the categorization. However, we have to write down the categories we are using.

8. Click **``OK``**, and you have created a new feature!

![6.1.2 J](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20J.png)

9. In the **``Layers``** panel select the _Italica_ layer.
10. Right click and choose **``Open Attribute``** Table in the context menu.

![6.1.2 K](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20K.png)

In the table you will see the feature you just added. While in edit mode you can update the attributes data by double click on the cell you want to update.

![6.1.2 L](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20L.png)

11. Close the attribute table.
12. To save the new feature we just created, click on ![saveEdits](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionSaveEdits.png)_Save Edits button_.

Remember, if you’ve made a mistake while digitizing a feature, you can always edit it after you’re done creating it. If you’ve made a mistake, continue digitizing until you’re done creating the feature as above. Then:

1. Click on ![vertexToolActiveLayer](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionVertexToolActiveLayer.png)_Vertex Tool_ button.
2. Hover the mouse over a vertex you want to move and left click on the vertex.
3. Move the mouse to the correct location of the vertex, and left click. This will move the vertex to the new location.

![6.1.2 M](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20M.png)

![6.1.2 N](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.2%20N.png)

The same procedure can be used to move a line segment, but you will need to hover over the midpoint of the line segment.

If you want to undo a change, you can press the ![undo](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionUndo.png)_Undo button_ or Ctrl+Z.

Remember to save your changes by clicking the ![saveEdits](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionSaveEdits.png)_Save Edits_ button.

To enable the remaining feature editing tools, one needs to select the feature.

1. Click on the ![selectRectangle](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionSelectRectangle.png)_Select Features_ button in the Attributes Toolbar.
2. Click on the feature that was just created and the remaining buttons will become enabled.

![6.1.2 N](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/all_active_buttons.png)

See [User Manual](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/editing_geometry_attributes.html#sec-edit-existing-layer) for description of the other buttons in this toolbar.
3. When done editing, click the ![toggleEditing](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionToggleEditing.png)_Toggle Editing_ button to get out of edit mode, and save your edits.

### 6.1.3. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself: Digitizing Polygons
Digitize the amphitheatre and the theatre. If you please you can digitize some insulae.
Remember that each new feature needs to have a unique id value!

**``! Note``** 
When you’re done adding features to a layer, remember to save your edits and then exit edit mode.

**``! Note``**
You can style the fill, outline and label placement and formatting of the _Italica_ using techniques learnt in earlier lessons. The attribute _Type_ is to differentiate between the different building types without giving all of them the same _Name_.

### 6.1.4. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself: Digitizing Lines
After this short excursion to the site of Italica we will return to the Almanzora basin. You should add the vector files from the Module 6 exercise data to the Module 6 project and switch on the _**Iberpix basemap**_ layer. It might take a bit before the layer is loaded.

**``! Note``** If working with the WMS layers is too demanding for your internet connection you can opt to digitize the roads of Italica from the raster _L06_PNOA_MA_0984_Italica.tif_. The roads we will be adding is needed in the next Module, but will be made available with the exercise data.

We are going to digitize two roads which are not already marked on the roads layer. The city of Tagili must have been connected to the road network. However, our BA roads do not pass Tagili. The current consensus is that there was a road from Basti to Eliocroca and another from Basti to Baria. Since these two roads are not yet certain we will not add them to the existing road layer. 

Our road is thought to have followed the A-334 from Baza (Basti) to the River Almanzora at Serón. From there the road followed the river valley just beyond La Alfoquia. At this point the road splits in two directions: Lorca (Eliocroca) and Vera (Baria). The road to Eliocroca is thought to have followed the tributary valley of the Almalejo up to the village of Almalejo to join the A-7 to Lorca. The road to Baria would have followed the river Almanzora:

![6.1.4 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/6.1.4%20A.png)

1. Create a new ESRI Shapefile line dataset called _routes.shp_, with the same attributes as the _**roads**_ layer (use the approach above to guide you.) Using the same attributes as the layer it could belong to makes it easier to join the layers in a later stage.
2. Activate edit mode.
3. Since you are working with a line feature, click on the ![addLineFeature](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionCaptureLine.png)_Add Line_ button to initiate line digitizing mode.
4. One at a time, digitize the road from Basti to Eliocroca and the strectch to Baria on the _routes layer_. Try to follow the routes as accurately as possible, adding additional points along corners or turns. 

**``! Note``** 
How accurate the data needs to be depends on the zoom level. We can spend hours clicking at the 1 meter scale to trace roads exactly. However, if we are working on a much larger scale this accuracy is of no importance. (In this specific it would be foolish as we are creating a hypothetical road).

When digitizing features we need to keep in mind at what level of accuracy we want to work now, but also consider the likelyhood whether you will return to it later at a more detailed level. 

5. Set the _CLASS_ attribute value to _Minor Road_ and _CERTAINTY_ to _NO_.
6. Save your edits and toggle off editing mode by pressing the ![toggleEditing](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionToggleEditing.png)_Toggle Editing_ button.

### 6.1.5. In Conclusion
Now you know how to create features! This course doesn’t cover adding point features, because that’s not really necessary once you’ve worked with more complicated features (lines and polygons). It works exactly the same, except that you only click once where you want the point to be, give it attributes as usual, and then the feature is created. In Module 10 you will be adding point data, you can always refer back to this Module.

Knowing how to digitize is important because it’s a very common activity in GIS programs.

### 6.1.6. What’s Next?
Features in a GIS layer aren’t just pictures, but objects in space. For example, adjacent polygons know where they are in relation to one another. This is called topology. In the next lesson you’ll see an example of why this can be useful.
