## 10.1 Lesson: Georeferencing a Map
Although much archaeological data is available online and digitized, there are many datasets still published in print-media. Working with “Big Data” requires using as much data as possible. So it is important to learn, how to include such datasets in your analyse. 
This means that you will need to digitize the information at hand using your GIS. But before you can start the digitizing, there is an important first step to be done, scanning and georeferencing your paper map.

**The goal for this lesson:** To learn to use the Georeferencer tool in QGIS.

### 10.1.1. Scan the map
The first task you will have to do is to scan your map. If your map is too big, then you can scan it in different parts but keep in mind that you will have to repeat preprocessing and georeferencing tasks for each part. So if possible, scan the map in as few parts as possible.
If you are going to use a different map than the one provided with this manual, use your own scanner to scan the map as an image file, a resolution of 300 DPI will do. 
For this exercise you will use maps from the already scanned versions of Anuario Arqueológico de Andalucía, you can find them in the data folder  **_10.Module/Exercise_data/Raster_**.
For the following steps, we will use two of these maps: **_L10_AnArqAnd_GR2003.tif_**
and **_L10_AnArqAnd_AL1993.tif_**. We will do two georeferencings to show you to different ways of that process, depending on your available data.

### 10.1.2. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Georeferencing the scanned map with written coordinates

Open QGIS and set the project’s CRS to **`ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N (EPSG:25830)`** in **``Project ‣ Properties ‣ CRS``**, which is the currently used CRS in Spain.

![10.1.2 A CRS](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/10.1.2%20A%20CRS.png)
 
Save the QGIS project as **_georeferencing.qgs_**. 

To georeference the map:
* Open the georeference tool, **``Layer ‣ Georeferencer...``**.
* Add the map image file, **_L10_AnArqAnd_GR2003.tif_**, as the image to georeference, **``File ‣ Open raster``**.

Next you should define the transformation settings for georeferencing the map:
* Open **``Settings ‣ Transformation settings``**.
* Click the ![Path](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/path.png) icon next to the Output raster box, go to your own exercise folder and name the file as **_GR2003_georef.tif_**.
* Set the rest of parameters as shown below.

![10.1.2 B Transformation Settings](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/10.1.2%20B%20Transformation%20Settings.png)

* Click **``OK``**.

We added four red cross-hairs marking coordinates in the map, we will use those to georeference this image now. You can use the zooming and panning tools as you usually do in QGIS to inspect the image in the Georeferencer’s window.

**``! Note``**
Some maps have added coordinates this makes georeferencing a lot easier. In the example we use, the longitude and latidtude are displayed on the sides of the map, from there we were able to position the crosshairs. 

* Zoom in to the left lower corner of the map and note that there is a cross-hair which corresponds with two coordinates from the border (which are hardly readable because of the maps quality). You will use this point as the first ground control point for georeferencing your map.
* Select the ![Add Point](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/GRaddPoint.png)**`Add point`** tool and click at the intersection of the cross-hairs (pan and zoom as needed).
* In the **``Enter map coordinates``** dialogue write the coordinates that appear in the map (**`X`**: _`544000`_ and **`Y`**: _`4171000`_).
* Click **``OK``**.

The first coordinate for the georeferencing is now ready.
Look for the other three cross-hairs, the coordinates are: 

 + Left upper corner: **`X`**: _`544000`_ and **`Y`**: _`4186000`_
 + Right upper corner: **`X`**: _`555000`_ and **`Y`**: _`4186000`_
 + Right lower corner: **`X`**: _`555000`_ and **`Y`**: _`4171000`_

Digitize at least three more ground control points in the same way you did the first one. You should end up with something similar to this:

![10.1.2 C Points Preview](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/10.1.2%20C%20Points%20Preview.png)
 
With already three digitized ground control points you will be able to see the georeferencing error as a red line coming out of the points. The error in pixels can be seen also in the GCP table in the **`dX[pixels]`** and **`dY[pixels]`** columns. The error in pixels should not deviate more than 10 pixels, if it is you should review the points you have digitized and the coordinates you have entered to find what the problem is. You can use the image above as a guide.
Once you are happy with your control points, you can save them for later use:
* **``File ‣ Save GCP points as…``**.
* In your exercise folder name the file **_GR2003_georef.points_**

Finally, georeference you map:
* **``File ‣ Start georeferencing``**.
* Note that you named the file already as **_GR2003_georef.tif_** when you edited the Georeferencer settings.
Now you can see the map in QGIS project as a georeferenced raster. Note that the raster seems to be slightly rotated, but that is simply because the data was given in an older CRS and there is a small aberration of the crosshairs from reality, because of hand-drawing them in combination with a big scaled map with rounded coordinates.
To check that your data is properly georeferenced you can open the road layers in the **_10.Module/Exercise_data_** folder, named **_L10_BTN100_roads.shp_**. The roads (red, dashed line) on your map and in the vector layer should fit at least roughly:

![10.1.2 D Roads](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/10.1.2%20D%20Roads.png)

Save the changes to your QGIS project, you will continue from this point for the next lesson.

### 10.1.3. ![Moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png)  Follow Along: Georeferencing the scanned map without given coordinates
You learned how to georeference a map, which provides coordinates on it. Working with older datasets often bears the problem that a printed map is included, but no coordinates are given. Instead these maps are often including modern infrastructure (e.g. freeways, buildings…) or topographical conditions (e.g. rivers, coastline, mountains) as evidence, which area they show.  
Georeferencing of those maps is a bit more tricky and, depending on the maps quality and quantity of shown reference points, even a bit more imprecise. 
To try how that works, you have to add some layers with modern infrastructure and topography first: _**L10_BTN100_roads.shp**_, _**L10_BTN100_rivers.shp**_, _**L10_BTN100_towns.shp**_ and _**L10_BCN500_provinces.shp**_.

Now you follow along the above steps of the Georeferencer tool, but we focus on a different region with the map _**L10_AnArqAnd_AL1993.tif**_ from the _**Module 10/Exercise_data/Raster**_ folder. 
As you can see, no coordinates are given to help you. Therefore you need to identify other points, which are available on the map and within your added infrastructural data. Something like road-crossings and provincial borders are always helpful to identify fitting points, e.g:

![10.1.3 A Point Identification](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/10.1.3%20A%20Point%20Identification.png)
   
Now set a point at the crossing. When the **`Enter map coordinates`** dialogue appears, you have to click **``From Map Canvas``** instead of typing in coordinates. Now, QGIS puts you back to your project, where you have to identify the crossing at the  **_L10_BTN100_roads.shp_** layer and click it. After you have done that, you should automatically get back to the Georeferencer tool. From now on, everything works like it was explained above. Just repeat the described steps for at least three other points, which should be placed as near as possible to the maps border and distributed to all four edges and you are able to georeference this map. It is helpful to find more corresponding points distributed all over the map. The more you can identify correctly the more exact your referencing will be. Save your map and the points as you did before: _**AL1993_georef.tif**_ and _**AL1993_georef.points**_

### 10.1.4. In Conclusion
You have now georeferenced a paper map, making it possible to use it as a map layer in QGIS. You are able to reference maps with different kinds of reference information.

### 10.1.5. What’s Next?
In the next lesson, you will digitize information given in the georeferenced map. That means you will set points at the location of identified settlements and provide additional information in the attribute table.

## 10.2. Lesson: Digitizing Survey Information
Unless you are going to use your georeferenced map as a simple background image, the next natural step is to digitize elements from it. You have already done so in the exercises about creating vector data in: [6. Module: Creating Vector Data](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/6.%20Module:%20Creating%20Vector%20Data.md#6-module-creating-vector-data). In this lesson, you are going to digitize the results from archaeological survey i.e. setting points, where settlements have been identified.

**The goal for this lesson:** Learn to use your learned skill of digitizing elements in a archaeological case study.

### 10.2.1. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Adding Places and Data

Open your **_georeferencing.qgs_** project in QGIS, that you saved from the previous lesson.
We georeferenced two maps during our last lesson. Now we will continue digitizing map content by using the map of “Proyecto Alto Almanzora. Primera Fase” from the AnArqAnd1993, which you saved before. You can use a prepared version of that by loading **_L10_AnArqAnd_AL1993_georef.tif_** from the exercise data.

On the map, you see 38 dots with numbers, representing settlements of different epochs, which were identified during the survey. At first, we want to digitize them as points. Therefore, we add a new point layer (as you learned in [Lesson 6.1](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/6.%20Module:%20Creating%20Vector%20Data.md#61-lesson-creating-a-new-vector-dataset)) with columns **`No.`** (**`type`**: **`Whole number`**, **`length`**: _`5`_), **`Name`** (**`type`**: **`Text`**, **`length`**: _`200`_), **`Dating`** (**`type`**: **`Text`**, **`length`**: _`200`_) and save it as **_AL1993_survey_points.shp_**. Now, you can add points by enabling the edit-mode of the layer and using ![CapturePoint](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionCapturePoint.png) **`Add point feature`**. Just add a point for every dot of the survey now and fill in the attribute data. The **`id`** must be consecutive numbers and will at first be the same values as **`No.`** You will find the associated data (names and dates) of each point within the PDF (stored in **10.Module/AnArqAnd**) of the article (AL1993) on page 11. (The article is in Spanish, however, we only need the list with information).

We can add the dating information as text and later query the different periods. However, we have to make sure we use the exact same spelling. For example 'Roman'and 'roman' are not the same. When creating our own data it is good to think about best practice for standardizing our attributes. Imagine adding a few hundred places and half way deciding to change the periodization or add a new category. We would have to redo our work to keep the data clean.

Number 8 consists of three parts. We want to have three similar points with different data for that, because we have no hint, how to differentiate these three settlements with the available data. Therefore, you start with a point for “Cerro de Alcóntar I” at the dots location. After you have finished all other places, open the attribute table, click the line of Alcóntar I so it is marked. Now you can copy (_CTRL+C_) the point and paste (_CTRL+V_) it two times into your layer. Just change the entries of **`id`**, **`name`** and **`dating`** to the information of Alcóntar II  and III and we are finished.    
 
### 10.2.2. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png)  Follow Along: Adding Survey Area
After adding the settlements, we also want to add the surveyed area, which is shown with a black, bold line on the map. Therefore, add a new polygon layer (name it: **_AL1993_survey_area.shp_**) and add a new polygon feature by clicking around the shape (see [Lesson 6.1](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/6.%20Module:%20Creating%20Vector%20Data.md#61-lesson-creating-a-new-vector-dataset)). After finishing, you just have to fill in the **`id`**, because we didn’t add any columns to the attribute table in the beginning. We want to change that now. Therefore open the attribute table click ![NewAttribute](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionNewAttribute.png) **`New field`** and use the following settings in the appearing dialogue: **`Name`**: _`name`_, **`Type`**: **`text`**, **`Length`**: _`200`_. Now click on the newly added name field and type: _`Upper Almanzora Project. Stage one`_. After that, save your changes and disable the edit mode.

### 10.2.3. ![Moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png)  Try Yourself: Add more maps and content
We gave you many more survey maps and data of the AnArqAnd in the folder **_10.Module/AnArqAnd_** and the corresponding articles with survey information in **_10.Module/AnArqAnd_**. Try to georeference them on your own and add all data given in the associated article. Some will be easy to finish, others will be complicated, because of very few corresponding reference features within the map and the infrastructural layers. You can choose to add all the points to different layers or instead, using our **_AL1993_survey_points.shp_** layer for all of them. If you choose the latter, we recommend to add a new column and add information from which survey or article a point came. Otherwise you will quickly loose overview.  

### 10.2.4. In Conclusion
You have added information from surveys to your georeferenced maps. This is the base for executing different analysis. 

### 10.2.5. What’s Next?
In the next lesson, you will learn how to execute your first analysis with the digitized survey data.
