# 13. Walking Distance and improved Site Catchment
This module extends the site catchment analysis presented in [Module 12](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/12.%20Module:_Site_Catchment.md#12-site-catchment). There we have already learned how to analyse a basic 2 km territory around a settlement. In this module, on the other hand, we learn how to calculate a buffer based on the terrain conditions. For this we turn to a Walking distance analyses, this calculates an area around a point reachable within a predefined period of time. We will look at walking distance of one hour rather than the earlier used fixed 2 km radius. 
The section continues on the knowledge obtained in earlier modules and and will not be explained again. With the inbuilt links you can refer back to the needed sections on other Modules. As always, we have prepared the layers for this Module so you don’t need to create them by walking through the whole course. You can find these here: [Exercise data and Additional educational material]( https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vrD5bOE0l3ls2YFKXVWVHiWYQ1nRw6Mn?ths=true)
## 13.1 Lesson: Walking Distance
First, we will learn how to calculate which zones around a settlement point can be reached by walking for one hour using the implemented GRASS GIS function „r.walk“. As a basis for this calculation we will use the slope of the terrain.
**The goal for this lesson:** Learn to prepare and edit raster layers to perform the analysis.

### 13.1.1 ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Preparing the Analysis
In this example, we restrict ourselves to two settlement points at the upper Almanzora, which probably were both active during Roman times: Era de la Umbría (No. 30) and La Campana I (No. 34). So first use the layer _**L12_AnArqAnd_SurveyAlmanzora.shp**_ from module 12 and select these two points. Then save these in new layer by right-clicking the _**L12_AnArqAnd_SurveyAlmanzora.shp**_ and follow through **``Export ‣ Save Selected Features… ``** use the name _**L13_Sites.shp**_ for the new layer.
Now we need a slope layer (slope in percent!), which will be the base for our calculation. Here we use the raster layer _**L12_MDT25_Almanzora.shp**_ used in Module 12 and edit it. Initially, the area of this layer is much larger than needed for the analysis. Using larger raster files slows down all processes; this could lead to a QGIS crash. Therefore, we first cut it to the needed size. For our analysis, we will crop the raster to a 20 by 20 km square, but it does not have to be exact. You can therefore just do the trimming roughly with a drawn rectangle like this one:
 
![13.1.1 A](LINK TO IMAGE)
How to do that, you can look up in the QGIS Manual under [Raster Extraction](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/de/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/gdal/rasterextraction.html). Save the layer as a TIFF with the name _**L13_MDT_clipped.tif**_. 
Then we use this layer to calculate a slope layer (percent!) from it, which we save as _**L13_Slope.tif**_. See [Module 12.1.3](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/12.%20Module:_Site_Catchment.md#1213--follow-along-calculating-the-slope)
Since we want to limit our analysis to the slope for the time being, we basically have all the data available now. However, the algorithm that we want to use in the following expects us to provide a _**Friction Cost map**_ in addition to the slope layer, which contains all variables that should be considered. Since we are not using any others, we therefore need to create a costless map that we can use.
To do this, we use **``Raster ‣ Raster Calculator``** and select _**L13_MDT_clipped.tif**_ in the list at the top left by double-clicking on it. Then we write _`= 0`_ into the Expression-field to overwrite the layer with 0-values. We name the output layer _**L13_Cost0.tif**_  and click **``ok``**.

### 13.1.2 ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Estimating Costs
We now use the prepared data to calculate how far we can walk from the two settlement points in one hour. For this we use the **``r.walk``** via **``Processing  ‣ Toolbox``** and search for the GRASS-GIS algorithm **``r.walk``**. We are offered multiple variants, since we have a point layer with our two settlements, we select **``r.walk.points``**. (See the [Grass Manual]( https://grass.osgeo.org/grass82/manuals/r.walk.html) for more info on the algorithm and the meaning of the parameters.)
We now select _**L13_Slope.tif**_ as input elevation raster map, _**L13_Cost0.tif**_ as friction cost layer and _**L13_Sites.shp**_ as start point layer. At the bottom of the window we select our data folder for **``Cumulative Cost``** and name the file _**L13_WalkingDistanceCosts.tif**_. The movement directions are not important for us at this point, so we uncheck **``Open output file after running algorithm``** and click **``Run``**.
The resulting map looks like a DEM at first glance. However, it no longer contains the heights or slopes of the terrain, but the time, starting from our settlements, needed to reach the respective position. This time is given in seconds. So a pixel with the value ``60`` indicates a point on the map that can be reached from one of our settlements within one minute walking time. 
We can therefore now set the map to show us how far we can walk in one hour. To do so, we open the properties of the layer and go to ![symbology](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/symbology.png)**`Symbology`** tab, there we choose **``Singleband pseudocolor``**, pick a suitable colour-ramp (we used the default one for this example and inverted the colours, see [8.2.3. Singleband pseudocolor]( https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/8.%20Module:%20Rasters.md#823--follow-along-singleband-pseudocolor). We then need 4 classes in the colour table, set as follows:
  
![13.1.2 A](LINK TO IMAGE)
This way we have set the classes to show hours. The blue band, with a maximum value of 3600 is one hour, there are 3600 seconds in one hour. The next band is 7200 seconds, thus two hours and so on. You can change the classes to show whatever time span you want to show. 

### 13.1.3 In Conclusion
This is a basic method to perform a Walking Distance Analysis. This can show us a more precise way of what area, or territory, is reachable within a set time. Moreover, it allows us to take in account the terrain of an area.

### 13.1.4 What’s Next?
Now that we have all the data prepared and evaluated, let us investigate how we can prepare that further for improved analysis.

## 13.2 Lesson: Defining 1hour territory
The map from chapter 13.1 gives us all the information we wanted to get and we also visualized the areas. However, if we want to continue working with this information, the raster representation is not sufficient for us. Therefore, we are now working on converting the results into usable vector files so that we can extend our site catchment analysis from Lesson 12.

### 13.2.1 ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Extracting 1 hour territory
As we have seen, the "Walking Distance" representation is very similar to the DEM. We can take advantage of this and now use a process that actually extracts contour lines from height values. However, our contour lines on this layer represent distances.
So we go to **``Raster ‣ Extraction ‣ Contour…``**. We select our _**L13_WalkingDistanceCosts.tif**_ as **``Input layer``** and enter ``3600`` for **``Interval between contour lines``** and name **``Attribute name**`` with ``DIST`` and click **``Run``**.
We have now obtained a line layer that redraws the distance per hour. However, if you open the attribute table, you will notice that there are many different lines representing the distance of one hour (DIST: 3600). This is the result of some small patches within the larger area being harder to reach than surrounding areas. We can check these areas by selecting a line and zooming in onto the selection. 
Whether we want to keep these small areas within an analysis or not, of course, always depends on the research question and detail. For simplicity, and to learn the process, we will limit ourselves here only to the main area at one hour distance.
To do this, we simply select the first line around our settlements with the selection tool:
 
![13.2.1 A](LINK TO IMAGE)

To be on the safe side, check in the attribute table that only one line is selected. Now we convert this line into a polygon. To do this, we open **``Vector ‣ Geometry Tools ‣ Lines to Polygones …``**, again we opt for the **``Selected features only``** and enter _**L13_1h-territory.shp**_ as file name and start the process.
As a result we get a territory around both settlements, which is reachable in one hour as a polygon, with which we can do further analysis.

### 13.2.2 ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try yourself: Single Territories
We have always worked on the territories of both settlements together so far. For further analyses, however, it can be quite important to know how large the reachable territory of each settlement is and how far and where these territories actually overlap.
Therefore, repeat the previous steps independently, but not for both settlement points together, but separately for "Era de la Umbría" and "La Campana I". In the end, you will get two polygons with territories whose overlapping areas you can look at.

### 13.2.3 In Conclusion
We used our results from 13.1 to create a vector file representing the needed walking distance of one hour. This vectorization of our raster data makes the data easier for further analysis.

### 13.2.4 What’s Next?
We created a buffer around our settlements using a one hour walking distance. This more precise application of the data can be used to redo the Site Catchment Analysis from module 12 and see how different the results can be.

## 13.3 Lesson: Improving Site Catchment Analysis
Now that we have calculated a territory within an hour's walk, we will reapply the analyses from Module 12 to that territory and apply a visualization option to it.

### 13.3.1 Try yourself: Catchment Analysis for 1 hour territories
You have already learned all the steps for Site Catchment Analysis in [Module 12]( (https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/12.%20Module:_Site_Catchment.md#12-site-catchment). Now use the 1 hour territory polygon layer to perform these steps again on your own and find ways to visualize your results. Your result should resemble a map like this:
 
![13.3.1 A](LINK TO IMAGE)

Comparing the results also shows very clearly how different the area used as a basis looks with 2km or 1h distance and what impact it can therefore have to the results of your evaluations.

**``! Note``**
There is a significant difference between 2km buffer and 1 hour walking, as one hour walking would roughly be 5 km (this is the speed used in the algorithm). However, as we already can see from the 2km buffer it completely ignores the impact of the territory. You could add a 5km buffer to see how these two differ.

### 13.3.2 In Conclusion
We definitely improved our Site Catchment Analysis from Module 12 by considering walking distance instead of using fixed 2 km territories. This is very helpful, if you, for example want to estimate roughly how large a territory of a settlement or city might have been.
But, as we stated earlier in [Module 12]( (https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/12.%20Module:_Site_Catchment.md#12-site-catchment), this is again far from being a complete and ‘reliable’ Site Catchment Analysis, especially concerning soil usage and possible agricultural capacity or the like. Such an analysis needs much more detailed information on land use in antiquity. In addition, we have to take into account that roads would speed up walking distance.
