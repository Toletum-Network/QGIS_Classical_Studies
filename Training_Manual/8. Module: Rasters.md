# 8. Module: Rasters

[Additional eductional material](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1kNIaW2MV8YGHMfRfvy9HYgtGuEAReFvD?ths=true)

We’ve used rasters for digitizing before, but raster data can also be used directly. In this module, you’ll see how it’s done in QGIS.

## 8.1. Lesson: Working with Raster Data
Raster data is quite different from vector data. Vector data has discrete features with geometries constructed out of vertices, and perhaps connected with lines and/or areas. Raster data, however, is like any image. Although it may portray various properties of objects in the real world, these objects don’t exist as separate objects. Rather, they are represented using pixels with different values.

During this module you are going to use raster data to supplement your existing GIS analysis.

**The goal for this lesson:** To learn how to work with raster data in QGIS.

### 8.1.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Loading Raster Data
Raster data can be loaded with the same methods we used for vector data. However we suggest to use the **``Browser``** Panel.

1. Open the **``Browser Panel``** and expand the exercise_data/raster folder.
2. Load all the data in this folder:

> * L08_PNOA_MDT25_HU30_0994.tif
> * L08_PNOA_MDT25_HU30_0995.tif
> * L08_PNOA_MDT25_HU30_1012.tif
> * L08_PNOA_MDT25_HU30_1013.tif

You should see the following map:

![8.1.1 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.1.1%20A.png) 

For orientation we can add the rivers of the Almanzora basin:

![8.1.1 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.1.1%20B.png)

There we have it - four images covering our study area.

### 8.1.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Create a Virtual Raster
Now as you can see after adding the rivers of the Almanzora basin, our research area lies across all four images. What this means is that you are going to have to work with four rasters all the time. That’s not ideal. It would be better to have one file to work with.

Luckily, QGIS allows you to do exactly this, and without needing to actually create a new raster file. You can create a **Virtual Raster**. This is also often called a _Catalog_, which explains its function. It’s not really a new raster. Rather, it is a way to organize your existing rasters into one catalog: one file for easy access.

To make a catalog we will use the **``Processing ‣ Toolbox``**.

1. Open the **``Build virtual raster``** algorithm from the **``GDAL ‣ Raster miscellaneous``**;
2. In the dialog that appears, click on the **``…``** button next to the **``Input layers``** parameter and check all the layers or use the **``Select All``** button;
3. Uncheck **``Place each input file into a separate band``**. Notice the text field below. What this dialog is actually doing is that it is writing that text for you. It is a long command that QGIS is going to run.

**``! Note``**
Keep in mind that you can copy and paste the text in the _OSGeo Shell_ (Windows user) or _Terminal_ (Linux and OSX users) to run the command. You can also create a script for each GDAL command. This is very handy when the procedure is taking a long time or when you want to schedule specific tasks. Use the **``Help``** button to get more help on the syntax of the command.

4. Finally click on **``Run``**.

**``! Note``**
As you know from the previous modules, **``Processing``** creates temporary layers by default. To save the file click on the **``…``** button.

![8.1.2](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.1.2.png)

You can now remove the original four rasters from the **``Layers``** Panel and leave only the output virtual catalog raster. You can export and save the virtual raster **``Export ‣ Save As…``** by right clicking the virtual layer. You will be shown the **``Save Raster Layer as…``** dialog. After you saved the virtual layer you can remove this from the **``Layers``** Panel. 

#### 8.1.3. In Conclusion
QGIS makes it easy to include raster data into your existing projects.

### 8.1.4. What’s Next?
Next, we’ll work on our raster data and see how symbolization is useful in the case of rasters as well.

## 8.2. Lesson: Changing Raster Symbology
There are many other forms of raster data, and in many of those cases, it is essential to symbolize the them so that they becomes properly visible and useful.
The dataset we have is a _Digital Elevation Model (DEM)_. It is a map of the elevation (altitude) of the terrain, allowing us to see where the mountains and valleys are, for example. While each pixel of the dataset of an aerial raster (as used for Italica in Module 6) contained color information, in a DEM, each pixel contains elevation values. As you will have noticed our raster is a grayscale representation. QGIS has automatically applied a stretch to the pixel values of the image for visualization purposes, and we will learn more about how this works as we continue.

**The goal for this lesson**: To change the symbology for a raster layer.

### 8.2.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Changing Raster Layer Symbology
You have two different options to change the raster symbology:

1. Within the **``Layer Properties``** dialog, by right-clicking on the layer in the Layer tree and selecting the **``Properties``** option. Then switch to the **``Symbology``** tab
2. By clicking on the ![symbology](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/symbology.png)_Open the Layer Styling panel_ button right above the **``Layers``** panel (shortcut F7). This will open the **``Layer Styling``** panel, where you can switch to the ![symbology](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/symbology.png)_Symbology_ tab.

Choose the method you prefer to work with.

### 8.2.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Singleband gray
When you load a raster file, if it is not a photo image like the one used for Italica, the default style is set to a grayscale gradient as the case in this module.

Let’s explore some of the features of this renderer.

![8.2.2 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.2.2%20A.png)

The default **``Color gradient``** is set to _Black to white_, meaning that low pixel values are black and while high values are white. Try to invert this setting to _White to black_ and see the results.

Very important is the **``Contrast enhancement``** parameter: by default it is set to _Stretch to MinMax_ meaning that the pixel values are stretched to the minimum and maximum values. Look at the difference with the enhancement and without. 

But what are the minimum and maximum values that should be used for the stretch? The ones that are currently under **``Min / Max Value Settings``**. There are many ways to calculate the minimum and maximum values and use them for the stretch:

1. **User Defined**: you enter the **``Min``** and **``Max``** values manually
2. **Cumulative count cut**: this is useful when you have some extreme low or high values. It _cuts_ the _2%_ (or the value you choose) of these values
3. **Min / max**: the _Real_ or _Estimated_ minimum and maximum values of the raster
4. **Mean +/- standard deviation**: the values will be calculated according to the mean value and the standard deviation

### 8.2.3. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Singleband pseudocolor
Grayscales are not always great styles for raster layers. Let’s try to make the DEM more colorful.

* Change the **``Render type``** to **``Singleband pseudocolor``**. If you don’t like the default colors loaded, select another **``Color``** ramp
* Click the **``Classify``** button to generate a new color classification
* If it is not generated automatically click on the **``OK``** button to apply this classification to the DEM

![8.2.3 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.2.3%20B.png)

You’ll see the raster looking like this:

![8.2.3 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.2.3%20A.png)

This is an interesting way of looking at the DEM. You will now see that the values of the raster are again properly displayed, going from blue for the lower areas to red for the higher ones.

### 8.2.4. Follow Along: Changing the transparency
Sometimes changing the transparency of the whole raster layer can help you to see other layers covered by the raster itself and better understand the study area.

To change the transparency of the whole raster switch to the **``Transparency``** tab and use the slider of the **``Global Opacity``** to lower the opacity:

![8.2.4 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.2.4%20A.png)

More interesting is changing the transparency for some pixel values. For example in georeferenced rasters (See Module 10) you can see a homogeneous color at the corners. To set these pixels as transparent, go to **``Custom Transparency Options``** in the **``Transparency``** tab.

* By clicking on the ![signPlus](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/symbologyAdd.png)_Add values manually_ button, you can add a range of values and set their transparency percentage
* For single values the ![contextHelp](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionContextHelp.png)_Add values from display_ button is more useful
* Click on the ![contextHelp](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionContextHelp.png)_Add values from display_ button. The dialog disappears, and you can interact with the map.
* Click on on the homogeneous color in a corner of the DEM
* You will see that the transparency table will be filled with the clicked values:

![8.2.4 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.2.4%20B.png)

Click on **``OK``** to close the dialog and see the changes.

The corners of georeferenced rasters (you can try this later in Module 10) will be 100% transparent.

### 8.2.5. In Conclusion
These are some the basic functions to get you started with raster symbology. QGIS also gives you many other options, such as symbolizing a layer using paletted/unique values, representing different bands with different colors in a multispectral image, or making an automatic hillshade effect (useful only with DEM raster files).

### 8.2.6. What’s Next?
Now that we can see our data displayed properly, let’s investigate how we can analyze it further.

## 8.3. Lesson: Terrain Analysis
Certain types of rasters allow you to gain more insight into the terrain that they represent. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are particularly useful in this regard. In this lesson you will use terrain analysis tools to find out more about the study area for the proposed residential development from earlier.

**The goal for this lesson**: To use terrain analysis tools to derive more information about the terrain.

### 8.3.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Calculating a Hillshade
We are going to use the same DEM layer as in the previous lesson. If you are starting this chapter from scratch, use the **``Browser``** panel and load the _L08_PNOA_MDT25_Almanzora.tif_.

The DEM layer shows you the elevation of the terrain, but it can sometimes seem a little abstract. It contains all the 3D information about the terrain that you need, but it doesn’t look like a 3D object. To get a better impression of the terrain, it is possible to calculate a _hillshade_, which is a raster that maps the terrain using light and shadow to create a 3D-looking image.

We are going to use algorithms in the **``Raster ‣ Raster terrain analysis``** menu.

1. Click on the **``Hillshade``** menu
2. The algorithm allows you to specify the position of the light source: Azimuth has values from 0 (North) through 90 (East), 180 (South) and 270 (West), while the Vertical angle sets how high the light source is (0 to 90 degrees). We will use the default values:

![8.3.1 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.3.1%20A%20hillshade_explanation.png)

3. Save the file in a new folder _raster_analysis_ within the folder _exercise_data/8.Module_ with the name _hillshade_
4. Finally click on **``Run``**

You will now have a new layer called **``hillshade``** that looks like this:

![8.3.1 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.3.1%20B.png)

That looks nice and 3D, but can we improve on this? On its own, the hillshade looks like a plaster cast. Can’t we use it together with our other, more colorful rasters somehow? Of course we can, by using the hillshade as an overlay.

### 8.3.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Using a Hillshade as an Overlay
A hillshade can provide very useful information about the sunlight at a given time of day. But it can also be used for aesthetic purposes, to make the map look better. The key to this is setting the hillshade to being mostly transparent.

1. Change the symbology of the original **``L08_PNOA_MDT25_Almanzora.tif``** layer to use the **``Pseudocolor``** scheme as in the previous exercise
2. Hide all the layers except the **``L08_PNOA_MDT25_Almanzora.tif``**  and **``hillshade``** layers
3. Click and drag the **``L08_PNOA_MDT25_Almanzora.tif``**  to be beneath the **``hillshade``** layer in the **``Layers``** panel
4. Set the **``hillshade``** layer to be transparent by clicking on the **``Transparency``** tab in the layer properties
5. Set the **``Global opacity``** to _50%_.

You’ll get a result like this:

![8.3.2 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.3.2%20A.png)

6. Switch the **``hillshade``** layer off and back on in the **``Layers``** panel to see the difference it makes.

Using a hillshade in this way, it’s possible to enhance the topography of the landscape. If the effect doesn’t seem strong enough to you, you can change the transparency of the **``hillshade``** layer; but of course, the brighter the hillshade becomes, the dimmer the colors behind it will be. You will need to find a balance that works for you.

Remember to save the project when you are done.

### 8.3.3. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Querying the raster
Unlike vector layers, raster layers don’t have an attribute table. Each pixel contains one or more numerical values (singleband or multiband rasters).

All the raster layers we used in this exercise consist of just one band. Depending on the layer, pixel values may represent elevation, aspect or slope values.

How can we query the raster layer to get the value of a pixel? We can use the ![identify](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionIdentify.png)_Identify Features_ button!

1. Select the tool from the Attributes toolbar.
2. Click on a random location of the **``L08_PNOA_MDT25_Almanzora.tif``** layer. **``Identify Results``** will appear with the value of the band at the clicked location:

![8.3.3 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.3.3.%20A%20identify_raster.png)

3. You can change the output of the **``Identify Results``** panel from the current _tree_ mode to a _table_ one by selecting **``Table``** in the **``View``** menu at the bottom of the panel:

![8.3.3 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.3.3.%20A%20identify_raster.png)

Clicking each pixel to get the value of the raster could become annoying after a while. We can use the _Value Tool_ plugin to solve this problem.

1. Go to **``Plugins ‣ Manage/Install Plugins…``**
2. In the **``All``** tab, type _value t_ in the search box
3. Select the _Value Tool_ plugin, press **``Install Plugin``** and then **``Close``** the dialog.

![8.3.3 C](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.3.3%20C%20value_tool.png)

The new **``Value Tool``** panel will appear.

**``! Tip``**
If you close the panel you can reopen it by enabling it in the **``View ‣ Panels ‣ Value Tool``** or by clicking on the icon in the toolbar.

4. To use the plugin just check the **``Enable``** checkbox and be sure that the **``L08_PNOA_MDT25_Almanzora.tif``** layer is active (checked) in the **``Layers``** panel.
5. Move the cursor over the map to see the value of the pixels.
6. But there is more. The Value Tool plugin allows you to query all the active raster layers in the **``Layers``** panel. Set the **``hillshade``** layer active again and hover the mouse on the map:

![8.3.3 D](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.3.3.D.png)

### 8.3.4. In Conclusion
You’ve seen how to derive a hillshade analysis product from a DEM. And you learned how to query the results. More raster analysis will follow in [Module 12](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/12.%20Module:_Site_Catchment.md#1213--follow-along-calculating-the-slope).

### 8.3.5. What’s Next?
Now you have two analyses: the vector analysis which shows you the potentially suitable plots, and the raster analysis that shows you the potentially suitable terrain. How can these be combined to arrive at a final result for this problem? That’s the topic for the next lesson, starting in the next module.
