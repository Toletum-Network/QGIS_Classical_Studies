# 4. Module: Classifying Vector Data

[Additional eductional material](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ckpgu6HoHplNZdSfsP9gTdAEE_LQRy3r?ths=true)

Classifying vector data allows you to assign different symbols to features (different objects in the same layer), depending on their attributes. This allows someone who uses the map to easily see the attributes of various features.

## 4.1. Lesson: Attribute Data
Up to now, none of the changes we have made to the map have been influenced by the objects that are being shown. In other words, all the land use areas look alike, and all the roads look alike. When looking at the map, the viewers don’t know anything about the roads they are seeing; only that there is a road of a certain shape in a certain area.

But the whole strength of GIS is that all the objects that are visible on the map also have attributes. Maps in a GIS aren’t just pictures. They represent not only objects in locations, but also information about those objects.

**The goal of this lesson:** To explore the attribute data of an object and understand what the various data can be useful for.

### 4.1.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Attribute data
Add the _**L04_E2KC_cities.shp**_ from the exercise data of Module 4. Open the attribute table for the **cities** layer (refer back to the section [Lesson: Working with Vector Data](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/3.%20Module:_Creating_a_Basic_Map.md#311--follow-along-viewing-layer-attributes) if necessary). Which field would be the most useful to represent in label form, and why?

### 4.1.2. In Conclusion
You now know how to use the attribute table to see what is actually in the data you’re using. Any dataset will only be useful to you if it has the attributes that you care about. If you know which attributes you need, you can quickly decide if you’re able to use a given dataset, or if you need to look for another one that has the required attribute data.

### 4.1.3. What’s Next?
Different attributes are useful for different purposes. Some of them can be represented directly as text for the map user to see. You’ll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

## 4.2. Lesson: Labels
Labels can be added to a map to show any information about an object. Any vector layer can have labels associated with it. These labels rely on the attribute data of a layer for their content.

**The goal for this lesson:** To apply useful and good-looking labels to a layer.

### 4.2.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Using Labels
First, ensure that the ![labeling](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/labelingSingle.png) button is visible in the GUI:

1. Go to the menu item **View ‣ Toolbars**
2. Ensure that the **Label Toolbar** item has a check mark next to it. If it doesn’t, click on the **Label Toolbar** item to activate it.
3. Click on the _places_ layer in the **Layers panel** so that it is highlighted
4. Click on the ![labeling](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/labelingSingle.png) toolbar button to open the **Labels** tab of the Layer Styling panel
5. Switch from **No Labels** to ![labeling](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/labelingSingle.png) **Single Labels**

You’ll need to choose which field in the attributes will be used for the labels. In the previous lesson, you decided that the _name_ field was the most suitable one for this purpose.

6. Select _name_ from the Value list:

![4.2.1 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/4.2.1%20A%20select_label_with.png)

7. Click Apply

The map should now have labels like this:

![4.2.1 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/4.2.1%20B%20labelled.png)

### 4.2.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Changing Label Options
Depending on the styles you chose for your map in earlier lessons, you might find that the labels are not appropriately formatted and either overlap or are too far away from their point markers.

**``! Note``**
Above, you used the ![labeling](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/labelingSingle.png) button in the **Label Toolbar** to open the **Layer Styling** panel. As with **Symbology**, the same label options are available via both the **Layer Styling** panel and the **Layer Properties** dialog. Here, you’ll use the **Layer Properties** dialog.

1. Open the **Layer Properties** dialog by double-clicking on the _places_ layer
2. Select the ![labeling](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/labelingSingle.png) **Labels** tab
3. Make sure **Text** is selected in the left-hand options list, then update the text formatting options to match those shown here:

![4.2.2 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/4.2.2%20A%20label_formatting_options.png)

4. Click **Apply**

That font may be larger and more familiar to users, but its readability is still dependent on what layers are rendered beneath it. To solve this, let’s take a look at the **Buffer** option.

5. Select **Buffer** from the left-hand options list
6. Select the checkbox next to **Draw text buffer**, then choose options to match those shown here:

![4.2.2 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/4.2.2%20B%20buffer_options.png)
7. Click **Apply**

You’ll see that this adds a colored buffer or border to the place labels, making them easier to pick out on the map:

![4.2.2 C] **ENTER map with labels**

Now we can address the positioning of the labels in relation to their point markers.
8. Select **Placement** from the left-hand options list
9. Select **Around point** and change the value of **Distance** to _2.0_ Millimeters:

![4.2.2 D](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/4.2.2%20E%20offset_placement_settings.png)
10. Click **Apply**

You’ll see that the labels are no longer overlapping their point markers.

### 4.2.3. In Conclusion
You’ve learned how to use layer attributes to create dynamic labels. This can make your map a lot more informative and stylish!

### 4.2.4. What’s Next?
Now that you know how attributes can make a visual difference for your map, how about using them to change the symbology of objects themselves? That’s the topic for the next lesson!

### 4.3. Lesson: Classification
Labels are a good way to communicate information such as the names of individual places, but they can’t be used for everything. For example, let us say that someone wants to know what each _XXlanduse_  area is used for. Using labels, you would get this:

![4.3 A] **ENTER image**

This makes the map’s labeling difficult to read and even overwhelming if there are numerous different landuse areas on the map.

**The goal for this lesson:** To learn how to classify vector data effectively.

### 4.3.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Classifying Nominal Data
1. Open the **Layer Properties** dialog for the _XXlanduse_ layer
2. Go to the **Symbology** tab
3. Click on the dropdown that says **Single Symbol** and change it to **Categorized**:

![4.3.1 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/4.3.1%20A%20categorised_styles.png)

4. In the new panel, change the **Value** to _XXlanduse_ and the **Color ramp** to **Random colors**
5. Click the button labeled **Classify**:

![4.3.1 B] **ENTER screenshot**

6. Click **OK**

You’ll see something like this:

![4.3.1 C] **ENTER screenshot**

7. Click the arrow (or plus sign) next to _XXlanduse_ in the **Layer list**, you’ll see the categories explained:


![4.3.1 D] **ENTER screenshot**

Now our **_XXlanduse_** polygons are colored and are classified so that areas with the same land use are the same color.
8. If you wish to, you can change the fill color for each **_XXlanduse_** area by double-clicking the relevant color block in the **Layers** panel or in the **Layer Properties** dialog:

![4.3.1 E](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/4.3.1%20E%20change_layer_color.png)

Notice that there is one category that’s empty:

![4.3.1 F] **ENTER screenshot**

This empty category is used to color any objects which do not have a landuse value defined or which have a NULL value. It can be useful to keep this empty category so that areas with a NULL value are still represented on the map. You may like to change the color to more obviously represent a blank or NULL value.

Remember to save your map now so that you don’t lose all your hard-earned changes!

### 4.3.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself More Classification
If you’re only following the basic-level content, use the knowledge you gained above to classify the **_buildings_** layer. Set the categorisation against the **_building_** field and use the **Spectral** color ramp.

**``! Note``**
Remember to zoom into an **XXXX** to see the results.

### 4.3.3. In Conclusion
Symbology allows us to represent the attributes of a layer in an easy-to-read way. It allows us as well as the map reader to understand the significance of features, using any relevant attributes that we choose. Depending on the problems you face, you’ll apply different classification techniques to solve them.

### 4.3.4. What’s Next?
Now we have a nice-looking map, but how are we going to get it out of QGIS and into a format we can print out, or make into an image or PDF? That’s the topic of the next lesson!
