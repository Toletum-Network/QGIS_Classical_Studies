## 12.1. Lesson: Combining Tools
In this lesson we will perform a basic site catchment analysis by combining different QGIS tools. We will therefore focus on just one surveyed area: the upper Almanzora valley in Roman times. You can expand the analysis by adding more areas/times of course. Needed data for every region is available at IGN (see data source information). You already learned some of these techniques and their combination in previous lessons. Now we will combine all that to one analysis.

**The goal for this lesson:** Learn to combine different tools to perform analysis.

**``! Note``** 
We will work with temporary layers during this module. If you want to do these lessons not at once, please make sure you make the temporary layers permament by right clicking them and choose either **``Make Permanent``** or **``Export ‣ Save Features As...``**. Otherwise your temporary layers will not be usable after closing QGIS and you have to repeat the previous steps.
 

### 12.1.1. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Buffering
For a catchment analysis of our settlements, we will need the following layers: _**L12_AnArqAnd_SurveyAlmanzora.shp**_, _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_, _**L12_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora.shp**_. As you learned within the additional material, there are different ways of performing such an analysis. We will use the simple way of calculating an area of 2km surrounding each settlement. 
Therefore open **``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣ Buffer``** and choose _**L12_AnArqAnd_SurveyAlmanzora.shp**_ as **`Input layer`**, a **`Distance`** of _`2.0`_ (and don’t forget to set the scale to **`kilometers`**!) and **`Segments`** to _`20`_. Your result should look something like this:

![12.1.1 A Buffer](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/12.1.1%20A%20Buffer.png)

### 12.1.2. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Refine catchment area
Now we want to subtract rivers from our estimated territories, because these are not useable for agriculture. To do that, use **``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣ Difference``** and choose your temporary _**Buffered layer**_ as **`Input layer`** and _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_ as **`Overlay layer`**. 

**``! Note``** You will notice that _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_ is a polygonal layer, in contrast to the earlier line layers we used for rivers before. To calculate the surface area of a river we need it to be polygonal rather than line data. When creating a new layer we have to consider the purpose.

**``! Note``** The process might take a while, depending of your computer's speed. 

We determined all land within 2 kilometres around every settlement now. To get an idea of what may have been cultivated in that area, we will now combine this with the modern land use layer from [CORINE Land Cover](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover). To do so, use **``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣ Intersection``**. Define the temporary _**Difference**_ layer as **`Input layer`** and the _**L12_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora.shp**_ as **`Overlay layer`**. Run the analysis.

The resulting _**Intersection**_ layer will not have the same layer style as _**L12_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora.shp**_. To get a better optical effect, we will now copy the layer style of _**L12_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora.shp**_ and paste it to our _**Intersection**_ layer. To do so right click the _**L12_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora.shp**_ layer. Select in the drop down list **``Styles ‣ Copy Style ‣ Symbology``**. Then right click the _**Intersection**_ layer and select in the drop down list **``Styles ‣ Paste Style ‣ Symbology``**. Layer and attribute table should now look like this:

### 12.1.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Calculating the Slope
Another useful thing to know about the terrain is how steep it is. If, for example, you want to build houses on the land there, then you need land that is relatively flat. Altough there is no need to have flat terrain for agriculture, steep slopes are normally avoided in farming (or the terrain will be terraced, which reduces a slope technically).
Therefore we asume, that ancient farmers avoided land with slope steeper than 27%. No we want to determine the area, that is steeper than that, to subtract it from our Buffers later. For this we need the elevation layer _**L12_MDT25_Almanzora**_ from the _**Exercise data**_.

There are two methods to do this.
We could use the algorithm from the QGIS Toolbox to calculate the **``Slope``** via **``Processing ‣ Toolbox ‣ Raster terrain analysis``**.

1. Open the algorithm
2. Choose _**L12_MDT25_Almanzora**_ as the **`Elevation layer`**
3. Save the output as a file with the name _**slope**_ in your exercise folder 
4. Click on **``Run``**

Or, we use the GDAL algorithm which we can access via **``Raster ‣ Analysis ‣ Slope``**. As you will notice here we have several of the options (but not all) we also found in the toolbox.

1. Open the algorithm
2. Choose _**L12_MDT25_Almanzora**_ as the **`Input layer`**. The algorithm will automatically chose the **`Band number`** as **`Band 1 (Gray)`**.
3. Save the output as a file with the name _**slope**_ in your exercise folder 
4. Click on **``Run``**

Now you’ll see the slope of the terrain, with black pixels being flat terrain and white pixels, steep terrain:

![12.1.3 A Slope](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/12.1.3%20A%20Slope.png) 

We now know how the slope looks like, but we wanted to know, which areas are steeper than 27%. Therefore use **``Raster ‣ Raster Calculator``**. Doubleclick your generated Slope-layer which should be shown at the left site of the window (if you have not renamed the layer it will automatically have been named _**OUTPUT**_). After that it should be added within the expression at the bottom. Now just add _`> 27`_ and at the bottom of the window `Expression valid` should be shown. If it says `invalid`, just check if there are too many spaces in your expression. 

![12.1.3 B Calc27](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/12.1.3%20B%20Calc27.png) 

Your result should look like this:

![12.1.3 C Slope27](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/12.1.3%20C%20Slope27.png) 

What you will realize is, that your raster is now just black and white. It is now parted in pixels which fullfill our request to be steeper than 27% (shown in white with number 1) and those who don't fullfill it (shown in black with number 0). We now want to subtract those areas which are steeper than 27% from our bufferzones. To do this, we first have to transform our raster layer into a vector Layer. Use **``Raster ‣ Conversion ‣ Polygonize (Raster to Vector)``** with the following settings and save it as **_suitableVector_**:

![12.1.3 D R2V](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/12.1.3%20D%20R2V.png) 

**``! Note``** 
If you have not managed to get the slope layer, you can use the _**L12_Slope27.tif**_

**``! Note``** 
The conversion might take a while depending on your computer's speed. 

After the process is finished you should see a polygon layer covering the whole area of our DEM. If you have a look into the attribute table, you will realize that there is a column named **`suitable`** which has values of *0* or *1*. This corresponds to the information of our raster (see above), so if you want to visualize that in a better way, just categorize your layer symbolization refering to the **`suitable`** column. 

Now let's subtract the not suitable areas (i.e. steeper than 27%) from our bufferzones. At first we have to select all polygones on our **_suitableVector_** layer which show not suitable areas (i.e. value *1* in **`suitable`** column). You can do that by hand of course, much easier and quicker is to use ![selectByExpr](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/selectByExpr.png) (**`Select by Expression`**= in your attribute table and make the following expression:

![12.1.3 E SelByExp](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/12.1.3%20E%20SelByExp.png) 


Now use **``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣ Difference``** again, choose the _**Intersection buffer**_ layer we edited already as your **`Input layer`** and your **_suitableVector_** layer as **`Overlay layer`** and activate **`Selected features only`** here.

**``! Note``** 
You might occur an error starting that process, which tells you something about `invalid geometries`. If that is the case, use **``Processing ‣ Toolbox ‣ Vector geometry  ‣ Fix geometries``** on your **_suitableVector_** layer and repeat the step above with the **_Fixed geometries_** layer instead. If it doesn't work anyway, you can use our prepared layer _**L12_suitableVector**_ from [Module 12 exercise data](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1BrZMKZvjOvSB6b260iq-gBqU6sIzbvtf?ths=true)

**``! Note``**
The processing might take a while depending on your computer's speed. However, it will take a massive amount of time if you forgot to check the **`Selected features only`** box. If in doubt shut down the processing and check whether you are only using the **`Selected Features`**. 

After processing correctly, you can save your new **_Difference_** layer, paste the Landcover-style to it again and your result should like similiar to this:

![12.1.3 F Catchm](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/12.1.3%20F%20Catchm.png) 


### 12.1.4. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself: Calculating the aspect

Aspect is the compass direction that the slope of the terrain faces. An aspect of 0 means that the slope is North-facing, 90 East-facing, 180 South-facing, and 270 West-facing.

Concerning plant cultivation, aspect is an important factor, because it has great influence on the amount of sunlight a plant gets. A combination of aspect and winds may also be responsible for avoiding some areas, as roman writers like Pliny and Varro already stated. To not complicate this analyse, we assume that north facing slopes are totally avoided. Now it's your turn, you can determine the aspect alike we did with the Slope in 12.1.3.

Use the **``Aspect``** algorithm of the **``Processing ‣ Raster terrain analysis``** to get the layer.

[Check your results](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/Answer_Sheet/Answer_sheet.md#1214---try-yourself-calculating-the-aspect)

And of course you can now try to subtract these areas by following along the steps in 12.1.3.

### 12.1.5. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Requesting information

**``! Note``** The attribute table holds information from the combined layers now. So you have many polygons for one settlement represent the different landcover-polygons.

Last we will calculate the area covered by every polygon. The attribute table already has a column called **`AREA_HA`**, but the numbers are from the original _**L12_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora.shp**_ layer. 
Make your layer editable, open the field calculator by clicking on the ![calculateField](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionCalculateField.png) icon in the attributes table, mark **``Update existing field``** and choose **`AREA_HA`**. Now search for **`Geometry`** and double click `$area` within the given list. This will calculate the area in square metres. Since our column is called **`AREA_HA`**, we should provide the numbers in hectare. Therefore, add _`/10000`_ to the Expression. You should now have a formula like this within it:
 
![12.1.5 A Calculator](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/12.1.5%20A%20Calculator.png) 

After clicking **``OK``**, your **`AREA_HA`** column should have been updated und you can save your _**Intersection**_ layer as your final _**Catchment Area**_ layer. 

**``! Note``** To perform a real catchment analysis, you have of course to use as much data as possible. Additionally we used modern land-use information. That is of course not showing ancient environment, but should explain, how the analysis is performed in QGIS. Determine an ancient environment is too complex to explain here in detail. If you would like to know more, please follow the given information within the additional educational material. 

### 12.1.6. In Conclusion
You have combined different QGIS included processes to perform a basic catchment analysis, which is used widely in different archaeological studies (mostly in a more complex form of course). Your outcome shows a settlement's territory within 2km, which is suitable for different types of agriculture and the CLC overlay tells you, what is cultivated there today. That might help to imagine, if that territory might have been used for agriculture in antiquity too or how productive that area could have been. Additionally you got the information how much of that area (in hectares) is used by every type of landcover, which might be helpful for further analyses and statistics.

### 12.1.7. What’s Next?
In the next lesson, you will learn to improve the Site Catchment Analysis by using Walking Distance instead of a fixed 2km territory.
