## 1.1. Foreword
Welcome to our course! We will be showing you how to use QGIS easily and efficiently. If you are new to GIS, we will tell you what you need to get started. If you are an experienced user, you will see how QGIS fulfills all the functions you expect from a GIS program, and more!

This course is an adaptation of the [QGIS Training Manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/training_manual/index.html) with a focus on the Iberian Peninsula in Antiquity. It is aimed at Classical Archaeologists and Historians with little expierence in GIS applications. We created the course as part of the [Toletum-Network](https://www.toletum-network.com/) activities.

### 1.1.1. Why QGIS?
As information becomes increasingly spatially aware, there is no shortage of tools able to fulfill some or all commonly used GIS functions. Why should anyone be using QGIS over some other GIS software package?

Here are only some of the reasons:
* _It’s free, as in lunch._ Installing and using the QGIS program costs you a grand total of zero money. No initial fee, no recurring fee, nothing.
* _It’s free, as in liberty._ If you need extra functionality in QGIS, you can do more than just hope it will be included in the next release. You can sponsor the development of a feature, or add it yourself if you are familiar with programming.
* _It’s constantly developing._ Because anyone can add new features and improve on existing ones, QGIS never stagnates. The development of a new tool can happen as quickly as you need it to.
* _Extensive help and documentation is available._ If you’re stuck with anything, you can turn to the extensive documentation, your fellow QGIS users, or even the developers.
* _Cross-platform._ QGIS can be installed on MacOS, Windows and Linux.

Now that you know why you want to use QGIS, these exercises will make you know how.

### 1.1.2. Background
In 2008 the original authors (see [1.1.5](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/1.%20Course%20Introduction.md#115-authors)) launched the [Gentle Introduction to GIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/index.html#gentle-introduction-gis), a completely free, open content resource for people who want to learn about GIS without being overloaded with jargon and new terminology. It was sponsored by the South African government and has been a phenomenal success, with people all over the world writing to us to tell us how they are using the materials to run University Training Courses, teach themselves GIS and so on. The Gentle Introduction is not a software tutorial, but rather aims to be a generic text (although we used QGIS in all examples) for someone learning about GIS. There is also the QGIS manual which provides a detailed functional overview of the QGIS application. However, it is not structured as a tutorial, but rather as a reference guide. Linfiniti Consulting CC. frequently ran training courses and realised that a third resource is needed - one that leads the reader sequentially through learning the key aspects of QGIS in a trainer-trainee format - which prompted the original authors to produce the QGIS Training Manual.
The full [QGIS Training Manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/training_manual/index.html) is intended to provide all the materials needed to run a 5 day course on QGIS, PostgreSQL and PostGIS. The course is structured with content to suit novice, intermediate and advanced users alike and has many exercises complete with annotated answers throughout the text.

Our QGIS Training Manual for Classical Studies is aimed at novice QGIS users and should take roughly 20 hours to go through.

## 1.2. About the exercises
Now that you know why you want to use QGIS, we can show you how.

**``! Warning``**
This course includes instructions on adding, deleting and altering GIS datasets. We have provided training datasets for this purpose. Before using the techniques described here on your own data, always ensure you have proper backups!
 
### 1.2.1. How to use this tutorial
Any text that **``looks like this``** refers to something that you can see in the QGIS user interface.
Text that **``looks ‣ like ‣ this``** directs you through menus.
_This kind of text_ refers to something you can type, such as a command, path, or file name.
_This/kind/of.text_ refers to a path or filename.

### 1.2.2. Tiered course objectives
This course caters to different user experience levels. Depending on which category you consider yourself to be in, you can expect a different set of course outcomes. Each category contains information that is essential for the next one, so it’s important to do all exercises that are at or below your level of experience.

#### 1.2.2.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Basic
In this category, the course assumes that you have little or no prior experience with theoretical GIS knowledge or the operation of GIS software.
Limited theoretical background will be provided to explain the purpose of an action you will be performing in the program, but the emphasis is on learning by doing.
When you complete the course, you will have a better concept of the possibilities of GIS, and how to harness their power via QGIS.
#### 1.2.2.2. ![Intermediate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Intermediate
In this category, it is assumed that you have working knowledge and experience of the everyday uses of GIS software.
Building on the instructions for the beginner level will provide you with familiar ground, as well as to make you aware of the cases where QGIS does things slightly differently from other software you may be used to. You will also learn how to use analysis functions in QGIS.
When you complete the course, you should be comfortable with using QGIS for all of the functions you usually need for everyday use.
#### 1.2.2.3. ![advanced](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/hard.png) Advanced
In this category, the assumption is that you are experienced with GIS software, have knowledge of and experience with spatial databases, using data on a remote server, perhaps writing scripts for analysis purposes, etc.

Building on the instructions for the other two levels will familiarize you with the approach that the QGIS interface follows, and will ensure that you know how to access the basic functions that you need. You will also be shown how to make use of the QGIS plugin system, database access, and so on.

When you complete the course, you should be well-acquainted with the everyday operation of QGIS, as well as its more advanced functions.

### 1.2.3. Data

Download the prepared dataset from the [Training data repository](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AlBkPg3Aa8Mpv_AXBNMmpuoK_nqtRE5G?usp=sharing) by click on the little downward arrow next to “AutumnSchool_2020” and choose “Download”. GoogleDrive will automatically zip all files and give you a complete download option. Please be aware, that the zipping will take a while, but google will inform you about the process. Please also note, that you can download every specific data for a module by using the link within the Training Manual instead of downloading everything in one go.

**``! Note``** 
The Training data only uses the data for the Iberian Peninsula. The above listed datasets from AWMC and Pleiades include all areas considered to be the Ancient World. The Project MERCURY (https://projectmercury.eu/) has a good repository for data on the whole Roman Empire see their [Datasets](https://projectmercury.eu/datasets/).
