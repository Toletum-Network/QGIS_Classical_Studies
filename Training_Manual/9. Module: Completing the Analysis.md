# 9. Module: Completing the Analysis

[Exercise data and Additional eductional material](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EqTNZhhCSkmQhYPK7otcpsJOE-glf-Cc?ths=true)

You now have two halves of an analysis: a vector and a raster part. In this module, you’ll see how to combine them. You will conclude the analysis and present the final results.

## 9.1. Lesson: Raster to Vector Conversion
Converting between raster and vector formats allows you to make use of both raster and vector data when solving a GIS problem, as well as using the various analysis methods unique to these two forms of geographic data. This increases the flexibility you have when considering data sources and processing methods for solving a GIS problem.

To combine a raster and vector analysis, you need to convert the one type of data to the other. Let’s convert the raster result of the previous lesson to a vector.

**The goal for this lesson:** To get the raster result into a vector that can be used to complete the analysis.

### 9.1.1. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: The **``Raster to Vector``** Tool

Make sure you have a project with the following files:

* your solution of the vector analysis from Module 7 (or Module 9 vector exercise data _L09_Landuse_Tagili.shp_)
* _L09_suitable.tif_ from raster exercise data for Module 9.

We have created _L09_suitable.tif_ file using the raster calculator (you will learn this raster calculation in [Module 12: 12.1.3](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/12.%20Module:_Site_Catchment.md#1213--follow-along-calculating-the-slope)). First we created a **``slope``** and **``aspect layer``** via the **``Raster ‣ Raster terrain analysis``** menu. Then we calculated the area with optimum conditions for farming:

* the slope is less than 20% 
* the field is south facing

With the Raster calculator we combined the **``slope``** and **``aspect layer``** layers into the **``L09_suitable``** layer, which has _0_ and _1_ values, where _1_ signifies a pixel located in an area with both optimum conditions for farming.

Now we want to combine these optimal conditions with the solution from Module 7 (you can also find this as _L09_Landuse_Tagili.shp_ in the Module 9 vector exercise data).  

* Click on **``Raster ‣ Conversion ‣ Polygonize (Raster to Vector)``**. The tool dialog will appear.
* Set it up like this:

![9.1.1 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/9.1.1%20A.png)

* Change the field name (describing the values of the raster) to **``suitable``**.
* Save the layer under _exercise_data/9.Module_ as _suitable_vectorized.shp_.

``**! Note**`` The process might take a while, depending of your computer's speed.

Now you have a vector file which contains all the values of the raster, but the only areas you’re interested in are those that are suitable; i.e., those polygons where the value of **``suitable``** is _1_. You can change the style of this layer if you want to have a clearer visualization of it.

### 9.1.2. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself
Refer back to the module on [vector analysis](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/7.%20Module:%20Vector%20Analysis.md).

* Create a new vector file that contains only the polygons where _suitable_ has the value of _1_.
* Save the new file as _exercise_data/9.Module_ as _suitable_vectorized.shp_.

### 9.1.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: The **``Vector to Raster``** Tool
Although unnecessary for our current problem, it’s useful to know about the opposite conversion from the one performed above. Convert to raster the _suitable_vectorized.shp_ vector file you just created in previous step.

* Click on **``Raster ‣ Conversion ‣ Rasterize (Vector to Raster)``** to start this tool, then set it up as in the screenshot below:

![9.1.3 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/9.1.3%20B.png)

* **``Input file``** is _L09_suitable_vectorized_.
* **``Field to use for a burn-in value``** is _123DN_.
* **``Width``** and **``Height``** are _2376_ and _1498_, respectively.

**``! Note``**
The size of the output image is specified here to be the same as the original raster which was vectorized. To view the dimensions of an image, open its metadata (**``Metadata``** tab in the **``Layer Properties``**).

* Next to **``Output extend (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)``** Click **``...``** and select **``Use Layer Extend..``**. Select _L09_suitable_vectorized_ in the pop-up and press **``OK``**. It will calculate the extend of the output file to corresponds with the _L09_suitable_vectorized_ layer. 
* Click **``OK``** on the bottom of the dialog to begin the conversion process.
* When it is complete, gauge its success by comparing the new raster with the original one. They should match up exactly, pixel for pixel.

**``! Note``**
The process might take a while, depending of your computer's speed.

### 9.1.4. In Conclusion
Converting between raster and vector formats allows you to widen the applicability of data, and need not lead to data degradation.

### 9.1.5. What’s Next?
Now that we have the results of the terrain analysis available in vector format, they can be used to solve the problem of which areas we should consider for the optimum location of villae.

## 9.2. Lesson: Combining the Analyses
Using the vectorized results of the raster analysis will allow you to select only those buildings on suitable terrain.

**The goal for this lesson:** To use the vectorized terrain results to select suitable plots.

### 9.2.1. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself

In [Module 7](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/7.%20Module:%20Vector%20Analysis.md#72-lesson-vector-analysis) we have established which areas would be possible villae locations based on the following criteria: 

1. They are within roughly 1h walking (5000m) from Tagili.
2. They must be on cultivated land.
3. Closer than 1500m to the main road.
4. Closer than 500m to a river.

With the vectorized raster we can further filter the results to only include:

5. The slope is less than 20%.
6. The field is south facing.

For the analysis we need the results of the vector analysis of Module 7 (If needed the layer can also be found in Module 9 vector folder as _L09_Landuse_Tagili.shp_) and the vecorized raster. 

* Filter the vectorized layer so it only shows the areas with suitable land (You can refer back to [7.2.4](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/7.%20Module:%20Vector%20Analysis.md#724--follow-along-start-a-project-and-get-the-data))

* Use the **``Intersect``** tool (**``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools``**) to create a new vector layer (you don't need to save it but can leave it as a virtual layer for now). Set the _L09_Landuse_Tagili.shp_ as **''Input Layer''** and the _L09_suitable_vectorized_ as **``Overlay Layer``**. You will notice that at the moment the analysis starts there will be a multitude of error reports mentioning "invalid geometry". This will look someting like this:

![9.2.1 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/9.2.1%20A.png)

The result of the intersect analysis makes little sense:

![9.2.1 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/9.2.1%20B.png)

**``! Note``**
If you find that the **``Intersect``** tool does not produce any results, check the CRS settings of each of your layers. The CRS must be the same for both the layers you are comparing. You may need to reproject one layer by saving the layer as a new file with the required CRS.

The "invalid geometry" refers to geometries with overlapping or intersecting features. These features have been skipped in the intersection analysis. As you can see one of the main suitable areas of within the reagion has an invalid geometry.

We have to fix the problem of the invalid geometries before continuing our analysis.

### 9.2.2. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Fixing Geometries 
Luckily QGIS has an built-in algorithm to fix geometry errors. In the toolbox we find the **``Vector geometry ‣ Fix Geometries``**. Run the algorithm and save the result as _suitable_vector_fixed.shp_.

As we filtered the **``suitable_vectorized``** to only show the suitable (value _1_) areas, the **``suitable_vector_fixed``** layer only includes these geometries. In one go we selected and fixed our data.  

### 9.2.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself Finishing the Analysis
Now we should be able to use the **``Intersect``** tool and finish the analysis.

### 9.2.4. In Conclusion
You have now answered the original research question, and can offer an opinion (with reasons, backed by analysis) for a recommendation regarding where it is likely to have villae located based on suitable farming land near the city of Tagili, the main road and rivers.

### 9.2.5. What’s Next?
Next you will present these results as part of your assignment.

## 9.3. Assignment
Using the print layout, make a new map representing the results of your analysis. Refer back to [Module 5](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/5.%20Module:%20Creating%20Maps.md#5-module-creating-maps) if needed. Include these layers:

* **``Cities``** (with labels),
* **``hillshade``**,
* **``rivers_almanzora``**
* **``solution``**,
* **``routes``** and
* **``DEM``**.

Write a short explanatory text to accompany it. Include in this text the criteria that were used in establishing the ideal conditions for villae.
