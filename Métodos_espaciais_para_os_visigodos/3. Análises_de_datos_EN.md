# Curadoria e análises de datos relacional e quantitativa

As we have seen we will be using data from different sources. Each time we are looking for data we have to consider the veracity of our sources. We will not go into historical source critisim, although it is a part of the work we as historians do and as such needs to be part of our data curation. The focus here will be on how to deal with the spatial information we are collecting.

## 3.1 Curadoria de dados
In our data package we find the _**Places_Visigothic_Councils_list**_. Here we have all people mentioned from the Third Council of Toletum (589) up to the Sixteenth (693). For good practice the first field 'Código' contains an ID number for each entry. The choice to make this numerical in ascending order per council is very helpful if we want to reorder the table. It is followed by 'Concílio' and 'Ano', both indicating the council by number and year. Then we have the 'Cargo (latím)' or position of the person followed by the place as 'Sede' and 'Sede (latím)'.

In our life we will find many of these lists in publications. They are spatial as they contain places. However, often people don't see the need, or don't know how, to convert this into a map. Knowing how to search for their coordinates we can rather easily convert them into working CSV files. However, data is seldomly easy and forward. You might notice some colored cells. These are problematic cells where we find conflicting data. For instance, the first red cell is ID 14, where the Sede is called Granada. The reason to label might not be clear at first sight. Granada is the site of the Roman city of Iliberris. However, when we look at other attestations of Iliberris we find that it is linked to Elvira. We as researchers have to find out why this descrepancy is in our list and how to solve this.

We also want to check the data 

### 3.1.1 ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Working with Excel
As we have seen Excel is actually a rather simple way to work with our tabular data. When uneleashing the full power of Excel we can work with our data in different ways. For example the sorting of data we just did was rather useful to find and correct some mistakes. However, Excel has more options. When using Excel some of us might actually get a bit frightened by the formulae. And they might seem scary at first. Noentheless, they can be very helpful and speed up our work quite a bit.

We have our list of people attending the councils. As we have seen there are places mentioned and we already have the coordinates in another list. We can copy paste each of these coordinates manually or we use a Excel formula: the XLOOKUP (PROCX in Portuguese).<br>
This formula allows us to search for attributes of data, when there is a shared identifying attribute. Video explaining [XLOOKUP]([https://support.microsoft.com/pt-br/office/v%C3%ADdeo-vlookup-quando-e-como-us%C3%A1-lo-9a86157a-5542-4148-a536-724823014785](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/xlookup-function-b7fd680e-6d10-43e6-84f9-88eae8bf5929))

Our data has possible shared identifiers with the name
=XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode]) 



Returning to the excel sheet _**Places_Visigothic_Councils_curated**_ with which we started earlier. While working with the places data
