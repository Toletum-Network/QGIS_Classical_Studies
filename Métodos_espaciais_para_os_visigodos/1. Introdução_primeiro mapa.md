# Introdução: primeiro mapa

The first session will introduce you to the interface of QGIS. Make sure you have installed the programme and downloaded the needed data before the course starts. If you have no experience with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) we advice you to take a good look at the interface. A detailed walk through can be found in the [Second Module](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/2.%20Module:_The_Interface.md#2-module-the-interface) of the course [QGIS for Classical Studies](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies#qgis-online-course-for-classical-studies).

The first online session will start with a short introduction of the course. Thereafter we will start to make our first maps by adding geospatial data to the GIS-project. From there we will start to make the first maps.

## 1.1 Introdução e interface

The course will start with a 30 minute presentation by the instructor. We will discuss the reasons for using GIS in the field of history. What we can and cannot do with GIS systems. We will also consider what data is spatial and how we can represent it.
<br>
A GIS allows us to visualize spatial data, that is information that has a position in a plain. This can be in the 'real' world, using existing coordinates we can place them in the GIS at their locations. However, we can also map data in reference to each other. As such it is possible to map elements within their own fictional coordinate system based on thier own relative position. For example, we can use the coordinates of Ptolemy to create his maps in QGIS.
<br>
I write 'real' world in '' as there is a slight problem with carthography: we are presenting data from the globe in a flat plain, or screen or in printed form. This means we have to convert the spherical shape (3D) of the globe to a planar shape (2D) or map projection. For this we need a Coordinate Reference System (CRS).
<br>
### Assignment ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png)
Open a new project with the CRS EPSG:4326 also called the WGS84.
In the lower bar you will see *Coordinate*, type 'world' in the *Coordinate* field and hit enter. Now you will see the world in the CSR WGS84. 
![Add world map](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/M%C3%A9todos_espaciais_para_os_visigodos/Images/World%20WGS84.jpg)
<br>
At the lower right corner we can switch the EPSG. Let's switch it to another familiar view: EPSG 3857, this is the WebMercator.

<br>
This projection is often used for webbased mapping, such as Google. These projections are cylindrical and they have the problem that they tend to exaggerate areas further from the equator:

<br>
To represent the plane we are working in as precise as possible we will be using a local projection the ERTS89/UTM 30N. This projection renders the Iberian Peninsula very precise, eventhough Portugal, Galicia and Catalunya fall outside the projection area. However, when we see the whole world, we can observe the problem of projections. Another benefit of this projection is the fact that it uses the metrical system, rather than degrees. This will be of importance when we start making buffers and calculate areas and distance. 
<br>
For more information see the section on projections and CRS in the [QGIS Gentle Introduction](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/coordinate_reference_systems.html). 

## 1.2 Dados no QGIS
We already added our first bit of data to our map by adding the world lay-out. This world map we have just added is a vector map.

### 1.2.1 Vector data
Vector data is one of the fundamental data types used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). It represents spatial information using discrete geometric shapes, such as points, lines, and polygons, along with associated attributes. Vector data is well-suited for representing features that have distinct boundaries and can be described with discrete coordinates.<br>
Vector data is versatile and can represent complex spatial relationships and topologies accurately. It allows for precise modeling of features and supports various types of spatial analysis, such as buffering, overlay, and network analysis. However, vector data can become quite dense and memory-intensive when dealing with extensive datasets or high-resolution imagery.
To understand more about Vector data you can review Modules [4](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/4.%20Module:%20Classifying%20Vector%20Data.md), [6](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/6.%20Module:%20Creating%20Vector%20Data.md) and [7](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/7.%20Module:%20Vector%20Analysis.md).<br>
There are three main types of vector data:
#### _Point data_
Points represent individual locations in space and are defined by a single pair of coordinates along the X and Y axis or latitude and longitude. In addition we plot pijnt data along a Z axis, giving it a value for heigth or depth. Besides the coordinates point data can hold attributes. Points can be used to represent features like cities, landmarks, or sampling locations.
<br>
In our case we will be working with the church councils of the Visigothic period. We can record the years in which places were represented at councils. In addition we might add other elements we are interested in such as demography, size, type etc. 

#### _Line data_
The second type of vector data is line data. In principle lines are sequences of connected points that represent linear features like roads, rivers, or trails. They can also be used to represent non-linear features by defining a series of connected line segments.

#### _Polygon data_
Polygons are closed shapes formed by connecting multiple points to create an enclosed area. They are used to represent features like land parcels, lakes, countries, and administrative boundaries.
<br>
Every time we start working with data we need to consider what type of data and what scale we are dealing with a city can be a point or a (number of) polygon(s). For example when working on the scale of the whole Iberian Peninsula we migth want to have cities rendered as points with attributes. However, when working within a smaller region, we migth want to render the city as a polygon, indication the rea that the city takes up in its territory. Or we migth even decide to create polygons for districts or even individual buildings.

Similarly we might want to select between polygon or line data. In our case we should consider for instance the use of provinces as either line or polygon data. For cartography we migth want to use line data as this indicates the boundary between two provinces. However, if we want to use GIS to select features within a province or we want to calculate the area of a province, we need to opt for a polygon.

### 1.2.2 Raster data
Raster data is another fundamental data type used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) alongside vector data. Unlike vector data, which represents geographic features using discrete geometric shapes, raster data represents spatial information as a grid of cells or pixels. Each cell in the grid contains a value that represents a specific attribute or measurement for that location on the Earth's surface.

Key characteristics of raster data in GIS include:

_Grid Structure_: Raster data is organized in a grid format, where each cell, also known as a pixel, corresponds to a specific geographic location. The size of the cells determines the level of detail in the dataset. Smaller cells result in higher resolution but may lead to larger data sizes.

_Cell Values_: Each cell in the raster grid contains a value that represents a particular attribute. This attribute can vary widely depending on the application. For example, a raster dataset could represent elevation values, temperature readings, land cover categories, or satellite imagery intensity values.

_Continuous Surfaces_: Raster data is well-suited for representing continuous surfaces or phenomena that change gradually over space, such as elevation, temperature, and precipitation. The grid structure allows for capturing variations across space.

_Spatial Analysis_: Raster data is commonly used for spatial analysis tasks such as interpolation, suitability modeling, and surface analysis. Analytical operations can be performed by evaluating the values of neighboring cells.

Raster data resolution affects the level of detail captured. However, it's important to note that finer resolution doesn't necessarily imply higher accuracy; accurate representation depends on the data source and processing techniques. Raster data can be memory-intensive, especially at high resolutions. Various compression techniques and formats, such as GeoTIFF and JPEG2000, are used to manage file sizes without significant loss of information.

We will use different types of rasterdata, such as Digital Elevation Map (DEM), which represents the the elevation of an area. This can be used for different types of terrainanalysis, however, we will use it mostly as a base map in combination with the derived hill shade. Another type of ratser data are satellite images. 

Raster and vector data have complementary strengths and weaknesses. While raster data excels in capturing continuous phenomena and is efficient for certain types of analysis, vector data is better for representing discrete boundaries and topological relationships. In practice, many GIS projects use a combination of both raster and vector data to achieve comprehensive geographic information representation and analysis.

### 1.2.3 Adding data to your project
Let's add the first layers. The **``Data Source Manager``** dialog allows you to choose the data to load depending on the data type. We’ll use it to load our dataset: click the ![Data Source Manager](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/Open%20Data%20Source%20Manager.png) **``Open Data Source Manager``** button.

If you can’t find the icon, check that the **``Data Source Manager``** toolbar is enabled in the **``View ‣ Toolbars``** menu.

![2.1.1 B Toolbar](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/2.1.1%20B%20Toolbar.png)

Load the _**Pacensis_Settlements.shp**_ vector dataset:
* Click on the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66669249/175533646-13e606fc-b39a-444e-968a-3ed247228800.png) **``Vector``** tab.
* Enable the ![radiobutton](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/radiobuttonon.png) **``File``** source type.
* Press the **``…``** button next to **``Vector Dataset(s)``**.
* Select the _**Pacensis_Settlements.shp**_ file in your directory with the files for the course.
* Click **``Open``**. You will see the original dialog, with the local file path filled in.

![2.1.1 C browser vector data](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/2.1.1%20C%20browser%20vector%20data.png)

* Ignore the **``Options``** fields.
* Click **``Add``** here as well. The data you specified will now load: you can see a _**Pacensis_Settlements.shp**_ item in the **Layers panel** (bottom left) with its features shown in the main map canvas.
* Close the **``Data Source Manager``** dialog

Congratulations! You now have a basic map. Now would be a good time to save your work.

### 1.2.4 ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself
Repeat the steps above to add the _**Pacensis_Roads.shp**_ and _**Pacensis_Territories.shp**_ layers from the same folder to the map. You can order your layers in the Layer Panel by dragging them: left click the layer you want to move, hold and drag up or down. If the CAWM layer covers your other layers, drag it to the lowest postion in the Layers Panel.
