# Introdução: primeiro mapa

The first session will introduce you to the interface of QGIS. Make sure you have installed the programme and downloaded the needed data before the course starts. If you have no experience with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) we advice you to take a good look at the interface. A detailed walk through can be found in the [Second Module](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/2.%20Module:_The_Interface.md#2-module-the-interface) of the course [QGIS for Classical Studies](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies#qgis-online-course-for-classical-studies).

The first online session will start with a short introduction of the course. Thereafter we will start to make our first maps by adding geospatial data to the GIS-project. From there we will start to make the first maps.

## 1.1 Introdução e interface

The course will start with a 30 minute presentation by the instructor. We will discuss the reasons for using GIS in the field of history. What we can and cannot do with GIS systems. We will also consider what data is spatial and how we can represent it.
<br>
A GIS allows us to visualize spatial data, that is information that has a position in a plain. This can be in the 'real' world, using existing coordinates we can place them in the GIS at their locations. However, we can also map data in reference to each other. As such it is possible to map elements within their own fictional coordinate system based on thier own relative position. For example, we can use the coordinates of Ptolemy to create his maps in QGIS.
<br>
I write 'real' world in '' as there is a slight problem with carthography: we are presenting data from the globe in a flat plain, or screen or in printed form. This means we have to convert the spherical shape (3D) of the globe to a planar shape (2D) or map projection. For this we need a Coordinate Reference System (CRS).
### Assignment ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png)
Open a new project with the CRS EPSG:4326 also called the WGS84.
In the lower bar you will see *Coordinate*, type 'world' in the *Coordinate* field and hit enter. Now you will see the world in the CSR WGS84. At the lower right corner we can switch the EPSG. Let's switch it to another familiar view: EPSG 3857, this is the WebMercator. This projection is often used for webbased mapping, such as Google. These projections are cylindrical and they have the problem that they tend to exaggerate area further from the equator:

Due to the projection the equatorial region is depicted smaller than the
