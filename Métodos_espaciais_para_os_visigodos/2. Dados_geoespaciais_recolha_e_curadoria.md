# Dados geoespaciais recolha e curadoria

[Regresso à primeira aula](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/M%C3%A9todos_espaciais_para_os_visigodos/1.%20Introdu%C3%A7%C3%A3o_primeiro%20mapa.md)

The class we will start collecting our own data from scratch. Where do we find data? How should we organise our data to fit it our spatial questions?

In preparation for the next meeting you need to work through the manual and prepare all the data. The session will go into the issues and challenges you have found.

## 2.1 Dados espaciais
In the last session you were handed some data and asked to create a map. However, in may cases you won't find data being delivered so easily.
Luckily there are some places where we can find geospatial data for Antiquity. The [Mercury project](https://projectmercury.eu/datasets/) is one of these very helpful sites where differet datasets are aggregated.

Now it is great to find usable data. However, we should not lose ourselves in a data collection frenzy. Just like we don't go into the library and randomly start reading books, we need to ask ourselves what data we need for our research questions. Moreover, we might encounter spatial data in a multitude of forms and want to use it for your research questions. Here we are on the intersection of our knowledge as historians, where source critisism is central, and spatial data. As historians we are used to consider our sources for their context and decide what we can use and what to discard. Often we need to do the same with spatial data.


### 2.1.1 Valor separado por vírgula o CSV
A very easy and basic way to collect and organise our spatial data is Excel. Similar to the Attribute Table of our files in QGIS we have, fields (colums) and rows (lines). The benefit of Excel is that we can work with a rather easy programme to start organizing our data and we can convert it to a format that can be read by QGIS: the CSV. 

The CSV, in portuguese Valor separado por vírgula, is a text file format that saves tabular data. The delimiter of te data is the comma, hence the name. It is good practice to avoid comma's in your attributes, to avoid problems when converting to CSV. All mark-up you use in Excel will be lost when saving it as a CSV. So the fancy coloring and filtering is lost in the CSV. 

However, let us start with taking a look at the Excel sheet that was the basis for our earlier Places 

Take a look at the excel sheet _**Places_Visigothic_Councils_list**_ in the data package for this class. Here we have all people mentioned from the Third Council of Toletum (589) up to the Sixteenth (693). For good practice the first field 'Código' contains an ID number for each entry. The choice to make this numerical in ascending order per council is very helpful. It is followed by 'Concílio' and 'Ano', both indicating the council by number and year. Then we have the 'Cargo (latím)' or position of the person followed by the place as 'Sede' and 'Sede (latím)'.

In our life we will find many of these lists in publications. They are spatial as they contain places. However, often people don't see the need, or don't know how, to convert this into a map. Therefore, they opt for a list without the needed spatial data (the Y and X colums, where we need to put the coordinates). But, how do we find the coordinates of these places?

As you might notice there are some places that have a PLeiades code. This code refers to the [Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/) dataset. Here you can search most ancient places. We can search by ancient or modern name. Note that spelling is important, but partial names also gives results. So best to write the bare minimum in order to find your result.

If we search Acii, or for its number 265765, we see the following info page:

The coordinates in Pleiades are given in [Decimal Degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees). This Geometry definition is the most usefull as it works for the whole world. This in contrast to a [UTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system) that is only valid within one UTM zone, for instance UTM 30N for Spain. Moreover, the DD system is rather simple in contrast to the Sexagesimal [DMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#Subdivisions) which is the famous degrees minutes seconds notation: 41°39′0″ N, 0°53′0″ W. The notation of DMS is prone to typos and mistakes. 

Knowing these different systems is of importance for the next way to locate coordinates. The forbidden source of information, Wikipedia. When we take for example 'Villanueva de la Fuente', we find no result in Pleiades, but Wikipedia gives us a result.
