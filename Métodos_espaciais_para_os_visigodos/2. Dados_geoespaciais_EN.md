## 2.1 Dados espaciais
In the last session you were handed some data and asked to create a map. However, in may cases you won't find data being delivered so easily.
Luckily there are some places where we can find geospatial data for Antiquity. The [Mercury project](https://projectmercury.eu/datasets/) is one of these very helpful sites where different datasets are aggregated.

Now it is great to find usable data. However, we should not lose ourselves in a data collection frenzy. Just like we don't go into the library and randomly start reading books, we need to ask ourselves what data we need for our research questions. Moreover, we might encounter spatial data in a multitude of forms and want to use it for your research questions. Here we are on the intersection of our knowledge as historians, where source critisism is central, and spatial data. As historians we are used to consider our sources for their context and decide what we can use and what to discard. Often we need to do the same with spatial data.


### 2.1.1 Valor separado por vírgula o CSV
A very easy and basic way to collect and organise our spatial data is Excel. Similar to the Attribute Table of our shapefiles in QGIS we have tabular data, that is we have fields (colums) and rows (lines). The benefit of Excel is that we can work with a rather easy programme to start organizing our data and we can convert it to a format that can be read by QGIS: the CSV. 

The CSV, in portuguese Valor separado por vírgula, is a text file format that saves tabular data. The delimiter of te data is the comma, hence the name. It is good practice to avoid comma's in your attributes, to avoid problems when converting to CSV. All mark-up you use in Excel will be lost when saving it as a CSV. So the fancy coloring and filtering is lost in the CSV.

However, let us start with taking a look at the Excel sheet that was the basis for our earlier _**Visigoths_Places.shp**_. Take a look at the excel sheet _**Places_Visigothic_Councils_curated**_ in the data package for this class. 

It looks quite complicated and there is quite a lot of information. For now you can ignore this, we will look at these later in the section on [Data curation](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/M%C3%A9todos_espaciais_para_os_visigodos/2.%20Dados_geoespaciais_EN.md#23-curadoria-de-dados). At the end of the many fields, or rows, you see a column minting. Here we want to enter new data. 

#### 2.1.1.1 ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Minting data
Read the article by Dr. Pliego on the Visigothic coins in the datapackage: _Pliego (2012) La Moneda Visigoda Anexo I_. Since the publication of her books on Visigothic coinage in 2009 there are some additions and changes. The article holds an annex (p. 217) with places and coins. Since we have places we have spatial data! We can enter and use this.

Think about what you want to enter. The excercise is not just to enter data from a publication into an Excel. It is also about deciding what data is useful and how to enter it. If you believe you need more colums to enter data, you can add these to the right by just entering data. Excel will automatically expand the table.

**`! Nota`**
There is not right or wrong, as long as you can explain why you are collecting the data.

With `crtl + F` you can search for place names within the Excel. It might be possible that you have to add a place. 

#### 2.1.1.2 ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Locating places
Although our list of places is rather long, rather quickly we encounter places which we cannot locate easily. The first case is Narbona. How do we locate _Narbona_ and enter it's coordinates?

As you might notice most places have a Pleiades code. This code refers to the [Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/) dataset (Yes you can also download the whole set under the tab [Downloads](https://pleiades.stoa.org/downloads)). Here you can search most ancient places. We can search by ancient or modern name. Note that spelling is important, but partial names also gives results. So best to write the bare minimum in order to find your result.

If we search Narbo, we get several results:
* **Narbonne, Narbon** = [246347](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/246347) Col. Narbo Martius <br>
Col. Narbo Martius (modern Narbonne) was established in Gaul in 118 B.C. as a Roman colony.
* **Narbon** = [246199](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/246199) Atax (river)<br>
The Aude river.
* **Narbonensis II** = [992827](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/992827)<br>
An ancient place, cited: BAtlas 101 H3 no. 1 (Narbonensis II)
* **Narbonensis I** = [991333](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/991333)<br>
An ancient place, cited: BAtlas 101 G3 Narbonensis I
* **Narbonensis, Narbonensis (province)** = [981537](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/981537)<br>
The Roman imperial province of Gallia Narbonensis.
* **Narbonensis, Narbonensis (region)** = [148141](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/148141)<br>
An ancient place, cited: BAtlas 15 C2 Narbonensis

Without any knowledge of the places and regions mentioned here we might get easily lost. We are looking for the place Narbona that was called **Narbo Martius**. So we click the link of the Pleiades number [246347](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/246347).

![image](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/assets/66669249/fe36f6e7-3344-45a2-93d4-97216e6313ce)

The coordinates in Pleiades are given in [Decimal Degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees), or DD. This Geometry definition is the most usefull as it works for the whole world. This in contrast to a [UTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system) that is only valid within one UTM zone, for instance UTM 30N for Spain, note Narbonne would be in 31T! Moreover, the DD system is rather simple in contrast to the Sexagesimal [DMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#Subdivisions) which is the famous degrees minutes seconds notation: 43°11′0″ N, 3°0′0″ W. The notation of DMS is prone to typos and mistakes. 

Knowing these different systems is of importance for the next way to locate coordinates. Our next challenge is to find _Cepis_. The place is not located with certainty, nonetheless, we will follow Dr. Pliego and located it in _Castelões de Cepeda_. 
Unfortunately, we find no result in Pleiades. However, the forbidden source of information, Wikipedia, gives us a result for [_Castelões de Cepeda_](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel%C3%B5es_de_Cepeda)

![image](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/assets/66669249/2b9413ca-cc80-48a7-94c0-0b062f969130)

For most places Wikipedia gives coordinates. These can be found on the top right of the page or in the side column with info on the place. When we click these coordinates we are brought to the [GeoHack page of _Castelões de Cepeda_](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?language=es&pagename=Castel%C3%B5es_de_Cepeda&params=41.200833333333_N_-8.3305555555556_E_type:city). Here we find the different notations of Geometry:

* DMS 41° 12′ 3″ N, 8° 19′ 50″ W
* Decimal 41.200833, -8.330556
* Geo URI	geo:41.200833,-8.330556
* UTM	29T 556130 4561268

Here we can copy the Decimal Degrees notation. Note, sometimes we find the degree sign `°` behind the DD notation, make sure you leave this out as it is not needed.

_Vada_ creates a problem, it's location is unknown. We will enter it without coordinates.
_Elbora_ seems to be a typing error and should be Elvora. Note that the association of Elvora with Talavera la Reina is disputed. Nonetheless, we follow Dr. Pliego.

Now we have a nice Excel sheet with data. But what to do with this? First we need to save it as a CSV. You can do this via "Save as..." and then select the CSV option:

![image](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/assets/66669249/4abcafa7-0a3e-4688-aee7-56bbe9d6f89e)

(Ignore the German ;-) 

For good practice we rename the file so it reflects the changes we have made: _**Places_Visigothic_Councils_minting**_
After saving the CSV in a good location, which we will remember later. We can start to add this to our project. Open your project.

**`! Nota`**
This minting data is very incomplete. For practice we have only collected the data from the annex. To create a complete list we need also to add the data from Pliego 2009 and search for possible new finds between 2012 and 2023!

### 2.1.2 ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Adding a Delimited Text layer
We can upload our CSV via the **``Data Source Manager``** dialog allows you to choose the data to load depending on the data type. We’ll use it to load our datast with minting. 

Click the ![Data Source Manager](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/Open%20Data%20Source%20Manager.png) **``Open Data Source Manager``** button. Select the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66669249/175493332-d80bc172-3e4e-4031-800f-6761694af71e.png) Delimited text tab and click the **``...``** to open the directory. Locate the CSV  _**Places_Visigothic_Councils_minting**_. 

![image](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/assets/66669249/9b5868d1-8e3d-47dd-a925-c0020aa2ba4b)


As CSV or Delimited text files can be very different we have to check our data before uploading it. The **``Data Source Manager``** gives us a multitude of options to tweak how we enter our CSV. Let's have a look at it from top to bottom ([More info on QGIS page](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/opening_data.html#geometry-definition)).

First we have our``File name`` with the directory. Followed by the ``Layer name``, in this case ``Places_Visigothic_Councils_minting``. And the ``Encoding`` of our file. Note that this is an important field to check. Often this is set on ``UTF-8`` or ``Latin-9``. At the bottom of the screen we see our **``Sample data``**. Before importing the data it is good to keep an eye on the changes here. If we find unexpected or strange signs in our attribute values, then we need to change the ``Encoding``.

However, we find that in the example screen above something weird is going on. There are no columns, but one long line of Text (String). You might notice there are quite some `;` between the different elements. No worries we can change this in the **``File Format``**.

Here we select the way our data is constrcuted. When we open the csv in Excel we can see the delimiter. In our case it is a semi-colon ``;``, so we have to select **``Custom delimiters``** and check the box _Semicolon_. 

**``! Note``** <br>
When working with a Delimited text it is important to decide on the delimiter and NEVER use this delimiter in your attribute values. This way we avoid problems with uploading our data. In the case you are working with data obtained from others (without a good practice of delimiters) we can select multiple delimiters in the "Custom delimiters".

When we have changed the **``Delimiter``** to the correct setting we will see that the **``Sample Data``** looks like a table. We can also see that QGIS automatically recognizes our data:
* Integer (32 bit)
* Decimal (double)
* Text (String)

If you notice a mistake here, for example your coordinates are Text (string) then it is good to return to your CSV and check for `°` or possible spaces. 

The **``Record and Field Options``** allows us to discard rows under ``Number of header lines to discard``. And indicate the Header of the colums with the ``First record has field names``.

**``Geometry Definition``** handles our spatial information. Here we can select the way our coordinates have to be read. Remember the different systems (DMS, DD and UTM). 
Then we select our ``Geometry CRS`` using the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66669249/175505355-8a54a79b-64ae-45dd-ba94-ffe4dcdc73da.png). We can alwas change the CRS later in our ``Layers panel``. For our data we use the ``CRS`` **EPSG: 4326 - WGS 84**. This is the coordinate system that forms the basis of the DD. 
 
Click **``Add``**, you can check the data in the project and if it is good, then click **``Close``**. 

Now we have added the CSV to our project. We can manipulate the symbology in the same manner as the shapefiles we have been doing before. The downside of the Delimited text layer is that we cannot edit it within QGIS. You will notice that the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66669249/175506009-b40aa1ef-3cbe-4801-967d-ef3150aa019c.png) ``Edit`` icon is grey. If we want to edit the attribute values we need to do this in the CSV and then save the CSV file. After hitting the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66669249/175506680-3bc64ce5-2c65-44f3-bdcd-22755cb9ea0d.png) ``Refresh`` button we will see the changes in QGIS.

**``! Note``**<br>
If you work with a CSV in QGIS and need to change anything else than attribute values (e.g. the name of the file, directory of the file, the names of columns or the number of columns), you will need to add the layer again.

#### 2.1.3 ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Delimited text to Shapefile
If we want to work with the data as Vector data in shapefile format we can save it as a ESRI Shapefile. Richt click the layer in the layer panel. Then **``Export ‣ Save Features As...``** and the "Save Vector Layer As..." panel opens. 
It should have ESRI Shapefile as default format. Choose the directory under File Name via ``...``, select the preferred folder.
Leave all other field to default. make sure the box "Add saved file to map" is checked and hit ``OK``. 

For more info on editing Vector data see [Module 6](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/6.%20Module:%20Creating%20Vector%20Data.md#6-module-creating-vector-data).


## 2.2 Digitalização de dados
We can encounter data in different forms. You have now seen how to work in Excel to create a CSV that can be changed into a shapefile. This is very useful for published Tabular data, or maybe collecting data from different sources. 

### 2.2.1 Georeferencing images
In some cases we want to obtain data from existing maps. For this we can use the georeference tool, **``Layer ‣ Georeferencer...``**. This tool allows us to georeference raster and vector data.  
We will work with a raster file. In the data package for this session you find the map with the "Germanic Kingdoms": _**Die Germanische Nachfolgestaate Westroms (NPAtlas)**_. Since we are interested in this period we might want to digitize the boundaries of the Suebic and Visigothic kingdoms. This map is part of the [Der Neue Pauly Supplemente I Online - Band 3: Historischer Atlas der antiken Welt](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/browse/der-neue-pauly-supplemente-i-3). As scholars of the Visigothic period we might not fully agree with the extends of the boundaries, but that is for later worry. Let us first start with the digitization of the map as it is.

However, before we start we need to ask ourselves a few questions: 
* _Why am I digitizing the image?_ As stated before, don't create spatial data just because you can. Do you really need it?
* _Is there a way to obtain the data directly from the original source?_ This is an important question. Although it is often easier to just digitize the data directly from a georeferenced image, it is seldomly the best solution. <br>
1. Georeferencing an image distorts the image as it will be warped to fit the projection you are using. If you are lucky the image is on the same projection you are using AND it has not been reshaped by editors. The latter is the worst, often editors of publications just so slightly change the width or heigth of an image to make it fit the page better. Thereby the geospatial relations are completely off. <br>
2. More importantly, eventhough it is a map the information might not be georeferenced at all. When you start georeferencing maps, you will notice that often very good looking maps are not created with a GIS. Places are placed on a map using a graphics programme, like Photoshop or Inkscape. Obviously, georeferencing these maps and then taking the information directly from these maps is not useful. However, they can be a help.<br>
3. Scale. as you will see in a minute, the boundaries are actually quite braod and cover a large area. Zooming in on Toledo you might notice a massive region is covered by the dot representing Toledo. Imagine you want to find a Late Antique villa. It is not very helpful to create data directly from this map. However, it can help narrowing down the area where to look for specific sites.  

#### 2.2.1.1 ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Georeferencing a map
To georeference our map we need points that are found in both the map and in our project. Make sure you have a few layers on for reference:
* the base layer _colorrelief1_
* the Sees layer
* add the rivers from the data package from this course.

To georeference the map:
* Open the georeference tool, **``Layer ‣ Georeferencer...``**.
* Add the map image file, _**Die Germanische Nachfolgestaate Westroms (NPAtlas)**_, as the image to georeference, **``File ‣ Open raster``**.

Next you should define the transformation settings for georeferencing the map:
* Open **``Settings ‣ Transformation settings``**.
* Set the Transformation type to Helmert (for more info on [Transformation types](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/georeferencer.html#available-transformation-algorithms)).
* Set the rest of parameters as shown below.

![image](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/assets/66669249/3c470d2a-2152-45ad-ac98-59e91c5c2c1a)

* Click **``OK``**.

**``! Nota``**
Some maps have added coordinates this makes georeferencing a lot easier. In the example we use, the longitude and latidtude are displayed on the sides of the map, from there we were able to position the crosshairs. 

* Select the ![Add Point](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/GRaddPoint.png)**`Add point`** tool and click at a feature in the map that will be easily recognisable.
  A pop-up will appear promting you to enter coordinates. We don't have the coordinates, so we will select the same feature within the map canvas.
* Click the button at the bottom: **`From Map Canvas`**
  The pop-up will disappear and you will be able to navigate the map. Drag and hold using the mouse wheel.
* Right click the feature on the Map Canvas
  You will automatically return to the pop-up and notice coordinates have been entered.
* Click **``OK``**.

Repeat adding reference points several times. The minimum is three, but often eight is the optimum. make sure these are spread out on the map.  

You should end up with something similar to this:

![image](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/assets/66669249/33d15113-cbfa-4ac2-8059-dfa1761e99a3)

**``! Nota``**
I have focussed on our region as I want the best result here. There will be more distortion in other regions, compare Italy.
 
Finally, georeference you map:
* **``File ‣ Start georeferencing``**.
Now you can see the map in QGIS project as a georeferenced raster. Note that the raster seems to be slightly rotated, this is the distortion to make the map fit our CRS.
To check that your data is properly georeferenced you can change the transparency of the layer and see if it roughly follows the base map. If this is not the case you could try another transformation, for instance Polynomal. But remember, this distorts the map more and makes the data you will draw from it less reliable. 

Now you have succesfully added the image to your QGIS project! But it is still not the data in the way you want it.

Have you remembered to save your project? Don't want to loose our work now.

### 2.2.2 Drawing vector from raster
It is time to create your vector data from this map. Remember we have three types of data:
1. Point data
2. Line data
3. Polygon data
It is clear that our boundaries are not going to be point data. Nonetheless, we have to decide whether we want to add the boundaries as plygon data, the way they are being presented in the image, or as line data. Both have (dis)advantages.

We will create polygon data as we want to color the area controlled by the kingdoms (remember polygon data has an area, line data doesn't). 

#### 2.2.2.1  ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Creating a Vector file
We will create the vector file for our kingdoms. For this we need another layer in our Data packages: _**Open_Water_IP**_ this is a polygonal vector file that represents the sees around the Iberian Peninsula. Very useful if we want less detail that the bathymetry, but still want blue color. Also note the Lacus Ligustinus and the Ebro delta.

1. Add _**Open_Water_IP**_ as you are used to do with Vector files.
2. Navigate to and click on the menu entry **``Layer ‣ Create Layer ‣ New Shapefile Layer``**. You’ll be presented with the **``New Shapefile Layer``** dialog, which will allow you to define a new layer.

3. Click **``…``** for the **``File name``** field. A save dialog will appear.
4. Navigate to your folder with the data of the project.
5. Save your new layer as _**Kingdoms.shp**_.
6. For **``Geometry Type``**, select **``Polygon``** from the drop down menu. <br>
This has no impact on the rest of the dialog, but it will cause the correct type of geometry to be used when the vector dataset is created.

The next field allows you to specify the Coordinate Reference System, or CRS. CRS is a method of associating numerical coordinates with a position on the surface of the Earth. See the User Manual on [Working with Projections](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_projections/working_with_projections.html#label-projections) to learn more.

7. Choose the default CRS associated with this project, which is EPSG:25830 ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N.

Next there is a collection of fields grouped under **``New Field``**. By default, a new layer has only one attribute, the **`id`** field (which you should see in the **``Fields list``**) below. However, in order for the data you create to be useful, you actually need to say something about the features you’ll be creating in this new layer. For our current purposes, it will be enough to add a field called _`Name`_ that will hold **`Text data`** and will be limited to text length of _`80`_ characters .

7. Replicate the setup, then click the **``Add to Fields List``** button.
8. Check that your dialog now looks like this:

![image](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/assets/66669249/c58ae33d-2a45-4f71-ab75-0e69750b53c5)

9. Click **``OK``**

The new layer should appear in your **``Layers``** panel.

## 2.3 Curadoria de dados
In our data package we find the _**Places_Visigothic_Councils_list**_. Here we have all people mentioned from the Third Council of Toletum (589) up to the Sixteenth (693). For good practice the first field 'Código' contains an ID number for each entry. The choice to make this numerical in ascending order per council is very helpful if we want to reorder the table. It is followed by 'Concílio' and 'Ano', both indicating the council by number and year. Then we have the 'Cargo (latím)' or position of the person followed by the place as 'Sede' and 'Sede (latím)'.

In our life we will find many of these lists in publications. They are spatial as they contain places. However, often people don't see the need, or don't know how, to convert this into a map. Knowing how to search for their coordinates we can rather easily convert them into working CSV files. However, data is seldomly easy and forward. You might notice some colored cells. These are problematic cells where we find conflicting data. For instance, the first red cell is ID 14, where the Sede is called Granada. The reason to label might not be clear at first sight. Granada is the site of the Roman city of Iliberris. However, when we look at other attestations of Iliberris we find that it is linked to Elvira. We as researchers have to find out why this descrepancy is in our list and how to solve this.
