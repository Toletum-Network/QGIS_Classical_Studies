# QGIS Online Course for Classical Studies

Originally Pieter Houten and Jan Schneider developed this course as a guided online course for the [Autumn School 2020](https://www.toletum-network.com/aktivitaten/internationale-herbstschule-onlinekurs-qgis-fuer-altertumswissenschaftler-innen/) of the [TOLETUM Network](https://www.toletum-network.com). Due to the nature of the TOLETUM research group and our own research topics the course is focussed on the Iberian Peninsula in the Roman period. Obviously, the focus of the material does not change the way QGIS can be used for Classical Studies. You can easily adjust the course to work on other regions and studies with your own data or with [open access data](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/1.%20Course%20Introduction.md#123-data). We do advice to go through the course using the prepared materials. Thereafter, you can use the course as a guide to create your own analysis with your own data.

Here we make the course available for everyone as a **self-study** resource. If you have any problems, we recommend to have a look into our [Issues](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/issues) section and browse through the closed issues. Another source for answers is the [GIS Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/). Maybe someone already had the same problem and a solution is posted. If not, raise a new issue here or on Stack Exchange so a member of the community can help you.

Besides self-study, we offer the possibility to book a **guided course** for groups, which includes personal help via e-mail, online individual and group meetings and a scheduled course framework. Or tailored workshops focussing on the use of GIS analyses. You can find our contact information [here](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/1.%20Course%20Introduction.md#116-individual-contributors).

**The aim** of the course is to learn how to use QGIS from basics to first analyses. The course is based on a written Training Manual starting from a blank project. This online manual is supplemented by online presentations, documents and the option of booking personal guidance. The content is based on open source data, focused on Classical Studies of the Iberian Peninsula. 

**``! Note``**<br>
The course description and included screen shots were orignally made with QGIS 3.16. We try to keep everything up to date with the ever progressing QGIS LTR versions. However, there might be some minor differences between our screenshots and your GIS, depending on your QGIS version or your operating system. The latest update of this course has been done for QGIS LTR 3.28.
