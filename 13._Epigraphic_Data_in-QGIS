This section is created for the Summer Course [De la piedra a tu pantalla](https://cursosextraordinarios.unizar.es/curso/2022/taller-de-la-piedra-tu-pantalla-introduccion-las-herramientas-de-la-epigrafia-digital) held in Zaragoza in June 2022. The section is a basic instruction to map and analyse epigraphic data obtained from open access websites. As such the page holds basic insctructions treated in more detail in other modules.


## 13.1. Epigraphic Data

**The goal for this lesson:** Understanding and using epigraphic data for spatial analysis.

**``! Note``** 
We will use epigraphic data obtained via 
 

### 12.1.1. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Buffering
For a catchment analysis of our settlements, we will need the following layers: _**L12_AnArqAnd_SurveyAlmanzora.shp**_, _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_, _**L12_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora.shp**_. As you learned within the additional material, there are different ways of performing such an analysis. We will use the simple way of calculating an area of 2km surrounding each settlement. 
Therefore open **``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣ Buffer``** and choose _**L12_AnArqAnd_SurveyAlmanzora.shp**_ as **`Input layer`**, a **`Distance`** of _`2.0`_ (and don’t forget to set the scale to **`kilometers`**!) and **`Segments`** to _`20`_. Your result should look something like this:

### 12.1.2. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Refine catchment area
Now we want to subtract rivers from our estimated territories, because these are not useable for agriculture. To do that, use **``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣ Difference``** and choose your temporary _**Buffered layer**_ as **`Input layer`** and _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_ as **`Overlay layer`**. 

**``! Note``** You will notice that _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_ is a polygonal layer, in contrast to the earlier line layers we used for rivers before. To calculate the surface area of a river we need it to be polygonal rather than line data. When creating a new layer we have to consider the purpose.

**``! Note``** The process might take a while, depending of your computer's speed.
