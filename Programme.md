Obviously, you are free to set your own time table. This is just an aid in planning the sessions within the weekdays of our course. 

## Meetings
We plan to have two different types of online meetings. First the group meetings where we are aim at treating the issues and challenges we have encountered with the whole group. In addition, we have slots where we are available for more personal guidance if needed. For the individual meetings (max. 20 min) you have to send an e-mail with a preferred time slot and your question to gistoletum(a)gmail.com. 

## Challenges and issues 
**``! Note``** Issue has two meanings here, it might refer to the problem you encounter during the course and the option in GitHub to raise an _issue_ related to the material. For more information on raising isuues see the GitHub Guide on [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). We treat these two meanings of issue as interchangable as you will have to raise issues via our course [Github](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/issues). The issue can be a problem with the walk through in the manual, the presentations or questions about the literature. Before raising an issue check whether the issue has already been raised. Please add a title to the issue stating clearly to which material it refers. This makes responding to your issue easier.
Everybody can respond to an issue, either by adding on to it, or by solving it. We will obviously be monitoring the issues and help where needed. This way we all benefit from each others knowledge and experience. 
More complicated or reoccuring issues will be discussed during the Q&A Group sessions. 

Although it is preferable to raise issues and questions via Github there is the possibility to send an e-mail to us via the gistoletum(a)gmail.com.
If you prefer to have a individual call to discuss an issue we ask you to flag this in your e-mail requesting the Q&A. This way we can optimize the time we have for the call.

If you cannot finish the course within the set time of one week we will be available afterwards for questions via Issues and/or e-mail. However, live Q&A will not be a possibility.
