This section is created by [Pieter Houten](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0002-7872-782X) for the Summer Course [De la piedra a tu pantalla](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/6e620c8c056454c908a899416d2eb0c27e007521/Summer%20course%20De%20la%20piedra%20a%20tu%20pantalla.pdf) in Zaragoza. The section is a basic instruction to map and analyse epigraphic data. As such the page holds basic insctructions treated in more detail in other modules. For the more detailed inscructions follow the links.

## 13.1. Epigraphic Data

For our epigraphic data we resort to the publications in corpora and journals or to the epigraphic databases. In the past years we have seen a rise in databases providing different (sub)sets of epigraphy. Each of these has their own focus and thereby also pitfalls. One of the major problems of the epigraphic datasets is the limited spatial information.

The databases we will turn to for our course are:

[Hispania Epigraphica](http://eda-bea.es/)
[Epigraphik-Datenbank Clauss/Slaby](https://db.edcs.eu/epigr/epi.php?s_sprache=en)
[Epigraphic Database Heidelberg](https://edh.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/)
[Trismegistos](https://www.trismegistos.org/)

Much of the data we will be using has been curated within the ERC-Project [LatinNow](latinnow.eu), which aims at publishing its [LatinNow database](https://latinnow.eu/online-resources-2/databases-and-data/) in September 2022, and the ANR/DFG-project [ATLAS](http://atlas-cities.com/) and its work-in-progress [Huma-Num database](https://geoapps.huma-num.fr/adws/app/5b1c0f10-7386-11ec-b348-11e51a07f6b0/).

**The goal for this lesson:** Understanding and using epigraphic data for spatial analysis.

**``! Note``** 
We will use the epigraphic data on the Conventus Pacensis. This data is digitally obtained Claus-Slaby and improved using the publications by d'Encarnação *IRCP* and *IRCP 25 anos depois*. 
 

### 12.1.1. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Buffering
For a catchment analysis of our settlements, we will need the following layers: _**L12_AnArqAnd_SurveyAlmanzora.shp**_, _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_, _**L12_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora.shp**_. As you learned within the additional material, there are different ways of performing such an analysis. We will use the simple way of calculating an area of 2km surrounding each settlement. 
Therefore open **``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣ Buffer``** and choose _**L12_AnArqAnd_SurveyAlmanzora.shp**_ as **`Input layer`**, a **`Distance`** of _`2.0`_ (and don’t forget to set the scale to **`kilometers`**!) and **`Segments`** to _`20`_. Your result should look something like this:

### 12.1.2. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Refine catchment area
Now we want to subtract rivers from our estimated territories, because these are not useable for agriculture. To do that, use **``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣ Difference``** and choose your temporary _**Buffered layer**_ as **`Input layer`** and _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_ as **`Overlay layer`**. 

**``! Note``** You will notice that _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_ is a polygonal layer, in contrast to the earlier line layers we used for rivers before. To calculate the surface area of a river we need it to be polygonal rather than line data. When creating a new layer we have to consider the purpose.

**``! Note``** The process might take a while, depending of your computer's speed.
