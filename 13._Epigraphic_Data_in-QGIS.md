# 13. Epigraphic Data in QGIS

[Exercise data and Additional eductional material](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T8gJAiNYTXrsWkUwT6pxyY8fJTVnYyNy?usp=sharing)

This section is created by [Pieter Houten](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0002-7872-782X) for the Summer Course [De la piedra a tu pantalla](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/6e620c8c056454c908a899416d2eb0c27e007521/Summer%20course%20De%20la%20piedra%20a%20tu%20pantalla.pdf) in Zaragoza. The section is a basic instruction to map and analyse epigraphic data. As such the page holds basic insctructions treated in more detail in other modules. For the more detailed inscructions follow the links to the main course.


**``! Note``** 
The [QGIS Online Course for Classical Studies](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies#qgis-online-course-for-classical-studies) uses 3.16 LTR screenshots. We will be using the QGIS 3.22 LTR ([Download here](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html#)) which might have a slightly different User Interface (UI).

The the project file in our drive is set to the Portuguese Coordinate Reference System: EPSG: 3763 ERTS89/ Portugal TM06.
It is advised to download all the data from the Drive and save it on your local drive. Files in the could tend to get corrupted due to network failures.

## 13.1. Epigraphic Data

For our epigraphic data we resort to the publications in corpora and journals or to the epigraphic databases. In the past years we have seen a rise in databases providing different (sub)sets of epigraphy. Each of these has their own focus and thereby also pitfalls. One of the major problems of the epigraphic datasets is the limited spatial information. Often databases chose to select a (modern) place to represnt all epigraphy of a specific region (e.g. the modern capital for all epigraphy of the municipality). This decision might be toavoid the problems we encounter when we start entering findspots: are these the primary location of the inscription, or was it found in a secondary location? despite these issues we can gather information from the datasets and where needed improve spatial information.

The databases we will turn to for our course are:

* [Hispania Epigraphica](http://eda-bea.es/)
* [Epigraphik-Datenbank Clauss/Slaby](https://db.edcs.eu/epigr/epi.php?s_sprache=en)
* [Epigraphic Database Heidelberg](https://edh.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/)
* [Trismegistos](https://www.trismegistos.org/)

Much of the data we will be using has been curated within the ERC-Project [LatinNow](latinnow.eu), which aims at publishing its [LatinNow database](https://latinnow.eu/online-resources-2/databases-and-data/) in September 2022, and the ANR/DFG-project [ATLAS](http://atlas-cities.com/) and its work-in-progress [Huma-Num database](https://geoapps.huma-num.fr/adws/app/5b1c0f10-7386-11ec-b348-11e51a07f6b0/).

**The goal for this lesson:** Understanding and using epigraphic data for spatial analysis.

**``! Note``** 
We will use the epigraphic data on the Conventus Pacensis. This data is digitally obtained via Clauss-Slaby and improved using the publications by d'Encarnação *IRCP* and *IRCP 25 anos depois*.

### 13.2 ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Starting our map
Open the project file .


13.2.1
First open project and check layers
we should have:
* base layer from CAWM
* roads
* places
* settlemnts

All these layers are in a very simple layout, no differentation at all. We will start with the roads. When we right click the layer _**Roads**_ we can open the **`Properties`**. Then **`Symbology`**. Here we can start creating a new way of displaying the layer. 
We have multiple options:
* No Symbols
* Single symbol (this is current)
* Categorized
* Graduated
* Rule-based
* Merged Features
* Embedded Symbols

We will use the ategorized. Under value we choose LAYER and the Symbol will be a simple line. Then we click categorize. 
We will now see that we have Main Road and Secondary Road. We can give them different colours, thickness and what we want. 

Next we will do something more complicated: we will diffrentiate the settlements layer. Here we have to select categorized again and then use "Type" for value. When we 
click "Classify we will see that several values have more than one entry. Sometimes we find that data is not entered as we would like to see.
However, we can solve this issue rather simply with another way of working with symbology: Rule-based.
When





Now we have a basic map of Pacensis and we can [upload the shapefile](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies/blob/master/Training_Manual/2.%20Module:_The_Interface.md#211--follow-along-prepare-a-map) with the inscriptions from the conventus Pacensis.

## EXTRA: adding a WMTS layer
Next we ad a base layer. We will use a raster file w
For our project we will use a WMTS (Web Map Tile Service) We find the Consortium of Ancient World Mappers (CAWM) online base layer, the WMTS via: http://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/index.html. At this page we also find other methods to upload their online maps for different GIS programmes.


For a catchment analysis of our settlements, we will need the following layers: _**L12_AnArqAnd_SurveyAlmanzora.shp**_, _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_, _**L12_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora.shp**_. As you learned within the additional material, there are different ways of performing such an analysis. We will use the simple way of calculating an area of 2km surrounding each settlement. 
Therefore open **``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣ Buffer``** and choose _**L12_AnArqAnd_SurveyAlmanzora.shp**_ as **`Input layer`**, a **`Distance`** of _`2.0`_ (and don’t forget to set the scale to **`kilometers`**!) and **`Segments`** to _`20`_. Your result should look something like this:

![12.1.1 A Buffer](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/12.1.1%20A%20Buffer.png)

### 12.1.2. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Refine catchment area
Now we want to subtract rivers from our estimated territories, because these are not useable for agriculture. To do that, use **``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣ Difference``** and choose your temporary _**Buffered layer**_ as **`Input layer`** and _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_ as **`Overlay layer`**. 

**``! Note``** You will notice that _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_ is a polygonal layer, in contrast to the earlier line layers we used for rivers before. To calculate the surface area of a river we need it to be polygonal rather than line data. When creating a new layer we have to consider the purpose.

**``! Note``** The process might take a while, depending of your computer's speed.
